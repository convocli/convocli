# ConvoCLI: A Modern Conversational Terminal for Android

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the vision for **ConvoCLI**, a Warp 2.0-inspired terminal emulator for Android that combines the power of Termux's Linux environment with a modern, conversational chat-like interface. The goal is to make terminal interactions more accessible and user-friendly while maintaining full compatibility with command-line tools like Claude Code.

## The Problem

### Initial Goal: GUI Wrapper for Claude Code
The original idea was to create a GUI Android app to run Claude Code. However, research revealed several blockers:

**Legal/Licensing Issues:**
- Claude Code is proprietary software with "all rights reserved"
- Governed by Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service
- Cannot legally bundle or redistribute without explicit permission
- Would violate trademark if using "Claude" branding

**Technical Challenges:**
- 78.4 MB package size
- Requires Node.js runtime on Android
- Complex dependency management
- Users still need their own API keys

### The Better Solution: Modern Terminal Emulator

Instead of wrapping Claude Code specifically, create a **next-generation terminal emulator** that:
- Provides a modern, conversational UI inspired by Warp 2.0
- Works with ANY command-line tool (Claude Code, npm, git, etc.)
- Maintains full Linux environment compatibility via Termux
- Is fully legal (GPLv3 open source)
- Can be distributed on F-Droid and GitHub

## Key Decisions & Rationale

This section documents the critical architectural and strategic decisions made during the planning phase, along with the reasoning behind each choice.

### Decision 1: Build General Terminal (Not Claude Code Wrapper)

**What we decided:** Create a modern terminal emulator that works with ANY CLI tool, rather than a Claude Code-specific wrapper.

**Why:**
- **Legal:** Claude Code is proprietary with "all rights reserved" - cannot legally redistribute or bundle without Anthropic's permission
- **Market:** Broader opportunity - supports git, npm, Python, Claude Code, and 1000+ other tools
- **User value:** One app for all terminal needs vs. single-purpose wrapper
- **Future-proof:** Not tied to one vendor's product lifecycle
- **Differentiation:** UI/UX innovation is the value proposition, not the wrapped tool

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- ⚠️ Broader scope = more complex project
- ⚠️ Can't market as "Claude Code for Android"
- ✅ But: Better long-term product with wider appeal

**Alternatives considered:**
- Request permission from Anthropic (unlikely to get, not responsive to timeline)
- Separate launcher app (poor UX, licensing still unclear)
- Build Claude Code-specific features anyway (flexible enough to add later)

---

### Decision 2: Fork Termux (Not Build From Scratch)

**What we decided:** Fork the Termux project and replace UI layer with modern Jetpack Compose interface.

**Why:**
- **Speed:** 2-4 months to MVP vs. 6-8 months building from scratch
- **Proven tech:** Termux has 5M+ users, battle-tested over 5+ years
- **Compatibility:** Full VT-100/ANSI emulation already implemented (3000+ lines)
- **Package ecosystem:** Users get access to 1000+ pre-compiled packages via apt
- **PTY implementation:** Complex pseudo-terminal interface already working
- **Community:** Can leverage Termux community knowledge and support

**What we get from Termux:**
- ✅ Terminal emulation layer (TerminalEmulator.java)
- ✅ PTY interface (JNI/C code for pseudo-terminal)
- ✅ Session management (TerminalSession.java)
- ✅ Package system (apt/dpkg integration)
- ✅ Linux userspace environment
- ✅ Android integration (storage, permissions)

**What we replace:**
- ❌ Old TerminalView (Canvas-based rendering)
- ❌ Traditional UI (standard terminal appearance)
- ❌ Basic input handling (simple text field)

**Effort comparison:**

| Component | Fork Termux | Build From Scratch |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Terminal emulator | ✅ Done (3000 lines) | ❌ 4-6 weeks |
| PTY interface | ✅ Done (500-1000 lines C) | ❌ 2-3 weeks |
| Package system | ✅ Done (5000+ lines) | ❌ 8-12 weeks |
| UI layer | 🔄 Replace (2-3 weeks) | 🔄 Build (2-3 weeks) |
| **Total time** | **2-4 months** | **6-8 months** |

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- ⚠️ Must use GPLv3 license (Termux is GPLv3)
- ⚠️ Inherit some Termux architectural patterns
- ⚠️ Must maintain fork as Termux evolves
- ✅ But: These are acceptable given time savings and proven reliability

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Build from scratch:** Too much time for core plumbing, delays market entry
- **Use Termux libraries only:** Still GPLv3, less integration control
- **Different terminal base (Android Terminal Emulator):** Less maintained, fewer features

---

### Decision 3: Fully Open Source (GPLv3), Not Proprietary

**What we decided:** Release entire application as GPLv3 open source, including UI innovation.

**Why this decision was necessary:**
GPLv3 is "viral" - any app that links to or includes GPLv3 code must itself be GPLv3. Since we're using Termux's terminal emulation libraries, we cannot legally make the UI proprietary.

**Legal analysis:**
```
App includes Termux code (GPLv3)
    ↓
Creates "derivative work" under copyright law
    ↓
Entire app MUST be GPLv3
```

**Why we embraced it (not just accepted):**

**Business advantages:**
- ✅ **Proven revenue model:** Successful open-source companies prove this works
  - Automattic (WordPress): $7.5B valuation, GPL software
  - Red Hat (RHEL): $34B acquisition, GPL software
  - GitLab: $15B valuation, open core
  - Tailscale: $100M+ revenue, BSD license
- ✅ **Service-based revenue:** Cloud sync, premium features, enterprise support
- ✅ **Developer trust:** Terminal users prefer open source for security/privacy
- ✅ **Community contributions:** Faster development with contributors
- ✅ **Better for hiring:** Shows we can build in public (Anthropic application boost)

**Technical advantages:**
- ✅ **F-Droid distribution:** Primary channel for open source Android apps (2M+ users)
- ✅ **Security audits:** Community can review code for vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Faster iteration:** Pull requests from community
- ✅ **Fork protection:** Quality/execution creates moat, not closed source

**Strategic advantages:**
- ✅ **First-mover advantage:** Be the "Warp for Android" before anyone else
- ✅ **Brand & community:** Hard to replicate even with source code
- ✅ **Network effects:** Larger community = more value
- ✅ **Press coverage:** "Open source" is newsworthy in developer tools

**Revenue model:**
```

**Alternatives considered:**

**Option: Network/IPC separation (two apps)**
```
App 1: Termux Service (GPLv3) - separate install
App 2: Convo UI (proprietary) - paid app
```
- **Rejected because:**
  - ⚠️ Poor user experience (two installations)
  - ⚠️ Complex IPC overhead
  - ⚠️ Google Play may reject split-app pattern
  - ⚠️ Doesn't align with developer tool values (transparency)

**Option: Dual licensing (negotiate with Termux)**
- **Rejected because:**
  - ⚠️ Termux has many contributors (need all to agree)
  - ⚠️ Time-consuming negotiation
  - ⚠️ Likely expensive or impossible
  - ⚠️ Delays project start

**Option: Clean room implementation**
- **Rejected because:**
  - ⚠️ 6-12 months additional development
  - ⚠️ High risk of bugs/incompatibility
  - ⚠️ Won't be as good as Termux initially
  - ⚠️ Opportunity cost too high

**Conclusion:** Open source is not a limitation—it's a strategic advantage for developer tools.

### Decision 4: Jetpack Compose (Not Traditional Views)

**What we decided:** Build UI entirely with Jetpack Compose, Android's modern declarative UI framework.

**Why:**
- **Modern standard:** 60% of top 1,000 apps use Compose (2025 data)
- **Perfect for chat UI:** Declarative state management ideal for message/block interfaces
- **Performance:** Optimized for smooth scrolling (LazyColumn)
- **Material 3:** Built-in support for latest design system
- **Developer experience:** Faster iteration with live preview
- **Future-proof:** Android's recommended approach going forward

**Technical advantages for our use case:**
```kotlin
// Declarative = Easy to reason about
@Composable
fun ConversationalTerminal() {
    LazyColumn {
        items(commandBlocks) { block ->  // Efficient scrolling
            CommandCard(block)           // Reusable component
        }
    }
}

// vs Old View system:
// - Manual layout inflation
// - ViewHolder patterns
// - Adapter boilerplate
// - Harder to customize
```

**Why Compose fits command blocks:**
- ✅ Each block is a composable component
- ✅ State changes automatically update UI
- ✅ Easy animations between states
- ✅ Chat-like interface is natural fit
- ✅ Material 3 cards/surfaces built-in

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ Termux uses old View system (must bridge)
- ⚠️ Learning curve for team (if expanding)
- ✅ But: Worth it for modern UX and development speed

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Traditional Views:** Outdated, more boilerplate, harder to customize
- **Flutter:** Cross-platform but not native Android, larger APK
- **React Native:** Extra JavaScript bridge, performance concerns for terminal

- Cloud Sync: 50 users × $5 = $250/mo
- Pro: 20 users × $10 = $200/mo
- Themes: 100 × $2 = $200 (one-time)
- **Total: ~$650/mo**

**Month 12 (10,000 active users):**
- Cloud Sync: 500 users × $5 = $2,500/mo
- Pro: 200 users × $10 = $2,000/mo
- Enterprise: 2 teams × 10 users × $50 = $1,000/mo
- Themes: 500 × $2 = $1,000/mo (one-time)
- **Total: ~$6,500/mo**

**Month 24 (50,000 active users):**
- Cloud Sync: 3,000 users × $5 = $15,000/mo
- Pro: 1,500 users × $10 = $15,000/mo
- Enterprise: 20 teams × 15 users × $50 = $15,000/mo
- Consulting: $5,000/mo
- **Total: ~$50,000/mo ($600k/year)**

**Why this works:**
- Core app free = maximum adoption
- Services = ongoing value delivery
- Not selling the code (it's open source)
- Selling convenience, features, infrastructure

**Precedents:**
- **Bitwarden:** Free password manager + $10/yr premium = $100M+ revenue
- **Standard Notes:** Free notes + sync = sustainable business
- **Termux itself:** Free + donations = actively maintained

---

### Decision 6: F-Droid Primary Distribution

**What we decided:** Distribute primarily via F-Droid, with GitHub releases as secondary.

**Why F-Droid:**
- ✅ **Natural fit:** Standard channel for FOSS Android apps
- ✅ **Target audience:** Developer tools users already use F-Droid
- ✅ **Termux ecosystem:** Where Termux users are (5M+ downloads)
- ✅ **No restrictions:** Google Play limits terminal apps, F-Droid doesn't
- ✅ **Trust factor:** F-Droid = open source credibility
- ✅ **Automatic builds:** They build from source (reproducible)
- ✅ **No fees:** Free listing (vs $25 Google Play)

**GitHub Releases:**
- Beta testing channel
- Early access to features
- Direct APK downloads
- Full control over timing

**Google Play Store (future consideration):**
- Wider audience (non-technical users)
- Better discovery for casual users
- **Challenges:**
  - Must target API 34+
  - Terminal app restrictions (Termux moved off Play)
  - Review delays
  - $25 fee
- **Decision:** Evaluate after F-Droid traction

**Distribution strategy:**
```
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): F-Droid + GitHub
├── Alpha testing via GitHub
├── F-Droid submission
└── Build initial community

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): F-Droid primary
├── Iterate based on feedback
├── Build reputation
└── Feature in F-Droid lists

Phase 3 (Months 7+): Consider expansion
├── Evaluate Play Store viability
├── Alternative stores (Amazon, Samsung)
└── Direct distribution (website)
```

---

### Decision 7: Command Blocks Architecture (Warp-Inspired)

**What we decided:** Organize terminal output into discrete "command blocks" - each command and its output as an atomic unit.

**Why this is the core innovation:**
```
Traditional terminal:
command1
output1
command2
output2
[all mixed together, hard to parse visually]

Convo terminal:
┌─────────────────┐
│ $ command1      │ ← Block 1
│ output1         │
└─────────────────┘
┌─────────────────┐
│ $ command2      │ ← Block 2
│ output2         │
└─────────────────┘
[clear visual separation, easy to understand]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Visual clarity:** Each command is isolated
- ✅ **Context preservation:** Clear what output came from what command
- ✅ **Actionable:** Can copy, share, re-run individual blocks
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly:** Touch targets, swipe gestures
- ✅ **History navigation:** Scroll through blocks like messages
- ✅ **Status indication:** Success/error/running states visible

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
data class CommandBlock(
    val id: UUID,
    val command: String,
    val output: String,
    val exitStatus: ExitStatus,
    val timestamp: Instant,
    val metadata: BlockMetadata
)

// Each block gets actions:
- Copy output
- Re-run command
- Share block
- Expand/collapse
- Add to favorites
```

**Inspired by Warp, adapted for mobile:**
- Warp: Mouse-driven, keyboard shortcuts
- Convo: Touch-optimized, swipe gestures, haptic feedback

**Handling edge cases:**
- **Full-screen apps (vim, htop):** Switch to traditional view
- **Interactive programs (ssh, REPL):** Live-updating blocks
- **Long output:** Pagination within blocks
- **Real-time output:** Streaming blocks that finalize on completion

---

### Decision 8: Hybrid Architecture (Termux Core + Custom UI)

**What we decided:** Extract and use Termux's core terminal libraries, replace entire UI layer.

**Architecture:**
```
Convo Application
├── Terminal Core (from Termux - GPLv3)
│   ├── TerminalSession.java
│   ├── TerminalEmulator.java
│   └── PTY interface
├── UI Layer (our code - GPLv3)
│   ├── Jetpack Compose components
│   ├── CommandBlockManager
│   ├── ConversationalInput
│   └── Theme system
└── Integration Layer (our code)
    ├── Bridge: Termux → Compose state
    ├── ANSI → AnnotatedString converter
    └── Block detection logic
```

**What we keep from Termux:**
- ✅ Terminal emulation (3000+ lines, battle-tested)
- ✅ Package system (apt/dpkg integration)
- ✅ Linux environment setup
- ✅ Android integration (storage, permissions)

**What we replace:**
- ❌ TerminalView (Canvas rendering)
- ❌ TermuxActivity (old architecture)
- ❌ ExtraKeys UI (keyboard extras)
- ❌ Settings UI (preferences)

**Why hybrid (not full fork):**
- Faster development (focus on UI innovation)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to upstream bug fixes
- Can replace Termux components later if needed

**Percentage breakdown:**
- ~20% Termux code (terminal plumbing)
- ~80% our code (UI/UX innovation)

---

### Decision 9: Cross-Device Session Sync (The Killer Feature)

**What we decided:** Build seamless cross-device session synchronization as a core differentiator.

**The problem this solves:**

Currently, developers face a painful workflow when switching devices:
```
Desktop: "Claude, build login API"
Desktop: Claude creates files, implements features
Desktop: git commit && git push
[Switch to phone]
Phone: git pull
Phone: "Claude, add mobile UI"
Phone: Claude asks "what API?" (LOST ALL CONTEXT!)
```

**The vision:**
```
Desktop: "Claude, build login API"
Desktop: Claude creates files
Desktop: Session auto-syncs ☁️
[Switch to phone]
Phone: Open Convo → "Continue: Login API"
Phone: "Now add mobile UI"
Claude: "I'll integrate with the API I just created..." (FULL CONTEXT!)
```

**Why this is revolutionary:**

**Problem:** Claude Code sessions are local-only
- Claude.ai (web/mobile/desktop) DOES sync conversations
- Claude Code CLI does NOT sync (sessions stored in `~/.claude/`)
- Active GitHub feature request (#7805) - but not implemented
- Third-party solutions exist (Depot) but not integrated

**Opportunity:** First terminal to solve this
- No other terminal offers cross-device AI conversation sync
- Unique even compared to Claude Code itself
- Natural extension of our cloud sync service
- Justifies premium tier pricing

**Why this works for Convo:**

**Technical feasibility:**
```
Session format: JSONL files in ~/.claude/
{
  "type": "user",
  "content": "Build login feature",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
{
  "type": "assistant",
  "content": "I'll create...",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "tool": "Write",
  "params": {...}
}
```

These files are:
- ✅ Well-structured (JSONL)
- ✅ Self-contained (all context included)
- ✅ Portable (no binary data)
- ✅ Syncable (text files)
- ✅ Append-only (easy conflict resolution)

**Architecture:**
```
Desktop (any platform)
├── Claude Code session
├── Export to Convo format
└── Upload to Convo Cloud

☁️ Convo Sync Service
├── Encrypted storage (E2E)
├── Real-time updates
├── Conflict resolution
└── Web dashboard

Android (Convo App)
├── Download session
├── Import to local terminal
├── Continue conversation
└── Full context preserved!
```

**Implementation phases:**

**Phase 1: Manual Export/Import (Month 2)**
- Export Claude Code sessions as JSON
- Import sessions into Convo
- Manual sync via file transfer/git
- **Value:** Session portability, backup

**Phase 2: Cloud Sync Service (Month 4-5)**
- Automatic background sync
- Encrypted cloud storage
- Web dashboard to browse sessions
- Multi-device support
- **Value:** Seamless device switching

**Phase 3: Real-Time Sync (Month 7-8)**
- WebSocket-based live sync
- See desktop session on phone in real-time
- Multi-device viewing
- Session branching (try different approaches)
- **Value:** True cross-device collaboration

**Revenue impact:**

This feature significantly strengthens the Cloud Sync tier:

**Updated Convo Cloud Sync ($5/month):**
- ✅ **Cross-device Claude Code sessions** ← NEW, huge value
- ✅ Command history sync
- ✅ Settings synchronization
- ✅ Session backup & restore
- ✅ Web dashboard access

**Conversion rate projection:**
- Base case: 5% of users pay for Cloud Sync
- With session sync: **20-30%** of users pay
- Users who use Claude Code: **40-50%** conversion

**Updated financial projections:**

**Month 12 (10,000 active users, 40% use Claude Code):**
- Cloud Sync: 1,600 users × $5 = **$8,000/mo** (up from $2,500)
- Pro: 200 users × $10 = $2,000/mo
- Enterprise: 2 teams × 10 × $50 = $1,000/mo
- **Total: ~$11,000/mo** (vs $6,500 without this feature)

**Month 24 (50,000 active users):**
- Cloud Sync: 10,000 users × $5 = **$50,000/mo** (up from $15,000)
- Pro: 1,500 users × $10 = $15,000/mo
- Enterprise: 20 teams × 15 × $50 = $15,000/mo
- **Total: ~$80,000/mo** (vs $50,000 without this feature)

**Competitive advantages:**

**vs Termux:**
- Termux: No sync at all
- Convo: Full session continuity

**vs Claude Code:**
- Claude Code: Local sessions only
- Convo: Cross-device sync built-in

**vs Warp:**
- Warp: Desktop only
- Convo: True mobile + desktop sync

**vs Depot (third-party):**
- Depot: External service, commercial
- Convo: Integrated, open source core

**Why competitors can't easily replicate:**
- Requires cloud infrastructure
- Need Android + desktop clients
- Complex conflict resolution
- E2E encryption expertise
- Integration with multiple platforms
- First-mover advantage (we define the UX)

**User experience:**

**In Convo app:**
```
Home Screen:

```

**Tap "Continue":**
- Full conversation loads
- Claude remembers all context
- Previous files, commands, state preserved
- Pick up exactly where you left off

**Security & privacy:**

- ✅ End-to-end encryption (user-controlled keys)
- ✅ Zero-knowledge architecture
- ✅ Optional: Keep sessions local-only
- ✅ Export sessions anytime (no lock-in)
- ✅ Open source sync client
- ✅ Self-hosting option (future)

**Marketing angle:**

**Tagline:** "Code on desktop. Continue on mobile. Claude remembers everything."

**Use cases:**
- Developer on commute: Start on desktop, finish on phone
- Emergency fixes: Continue desktop work from anywhere
- Multi-device workflow: Desktop + tablet + phone seamlessly
- Team collaboration: Share sessions with teammates
- Learning: Resume coding tutorials across devices

**Why this is THE killer feature:**

1. **Unique in market** - No other terminal does this
2. **Solves real pain** - Developers request this constantly
3. **Natural fit** - Extends our cloud sync offering
4. **Revenue driver** - 3x conversion rate vs basic sync
5. **Network effect** - More devices = more value
6. **Defensible moat** - Hard to build well
7. **Anthropic appeal** - Shows we understand Claude Code users
8. **First-mover** - Define the category

**Risks & mitigations:**

**Risk: Anthropic adds this to Claude Code**
- Mitigation: We'll have it first, better mobile UX
- Our sync works with ANY terminal tool, not just Claude Code
- Can still differentiate on UI/UX

**Risk: Privacy concerns with cloud sync**
- Mitigation: E2E encryption, open source, local-first option
- Users control their data
- Self-hosting option

**Risk: Complex to build**
- Mitigation: Start with manual export/import (Phase 1)
- Proven tech (JSONL parsing, REST APIs)
- Gradual rollout reduces risk

**Conclusion:** This single feature could make or break Convo's success. It transforms Convo from "nice terminal UI" to "must-have developer productivity tool."

### Decision 10: Jetpack Compose Reaffirmed (2025 Re-evaluation)

**What we decided:** After deep re-evaluation in late 2025, we confirmed that Jetpack Compose remains the correct choice over React Native despite team's Web/React background.

**Context:** When revisiting the tech stack decision with consideration for team's strong React/Web experience, we performed a comprehensive analysis of React Native 0.76+ (with TurboModules/New Architecture) as an alternative to Jetpack Compose.

**Analysis performed:**

**React Native 0.76+ (2025 State):**
- ✅ Production-ready New Architecture (default in 0.76+)
- ✅ TurboModules (JSI) for synchronous native bridge (~15-25ms latency)
- ✅ Reanimated 4.x + Gesture Handler 2.28.0 (cutting-edge)
- ✅ Team's existing React expertise
- ✅ Potential future iOS port path

**Jetpack Compose 1.9.3 (2025 State):**
- ✅ Latest stable (August 2025 release, BOM 2025.10.00)
- ✅ 60% adoption in top 1000 Android apps
- ✅ Direct Kotlin → Kotlin integration (zero overhead)
- ✅ React-like declarative patterns (lower learning curve than expected)
- ✅ Perfect F-Droid ecosystem fit

**Critical findings that reaffirmed Compose:**

**1. No Proven React Native + Termux Integration Pattern**
- Zero examples of React Native mobile apps with PTY (pseudo-terminal) integration
- No proven patterns for Termux fork integration with React Native
- `node-pty` exists only for Node.js/Electron (desktop), not React Native mobile
- `react-native-terminal-component` is 6 years old, JavaScript simulation only
- Would be pioneering this integration (high technical risk)

**2. Interactive Terminal Performance Concerns**
```
Performance comparison (research-based estimates):

Command execution (ls -la):
- React Native: ~25-35ms (acceptable ✅)
- Jetpack Compose: ~10-15ms (excellent ✅)

Streaming output (npm install, 1MB):
- React Native: ~400ms (needs batching optimization ⚠️)
- Jetpack Compose: ~200ms (direct buffer access ✅)

Interactive programs (vim, nano, htop):
- React Native: Every keystroke ~15-25ms bridge crossing (⚠️ could feel laggy)
- Jetpack Compose: Every keystroke ~0ms overhead (✅ native feel)
```

**3. Learning Curve Reality Check**
Initial assumption: "React Native = immediate productivity"

Actual requirement for BOTH approaches:
- Must learn Kotlin/Java anyway (for Termux fork modification)
- React Native: Learn TurboModules (new territory) + Kotlin for native bridge
- Jetpack Compose: Learn Compose (React-like, familiar mental model) + Kotlin
- **Time to working prototype: Similar (~10-12 weeks for both)**

**4. Architecture Complexity**
```
React Native Architecture:
┌─────────────────────┐
│   React Native UI   │
│   (JavaScript)      │
└─────────┬───────────┘
          │ TurboModules Bridge
          │ (~15-25ms per call)
┌─────────▼───────────┐
│  Native Wrapper     │
│  (Kotlin - NEW)     │
└─────────┬───────────┘
          │
┌─────────▼───────────┐
│   Termux Core       │
│   (Java/Kotlin)     │
└─────────────────────┘

- Two language contexts (JS + Kotlin)
- Bridge serialization overhead
- More complex debugging
- Unproven integration pattern

Jetpack Compose Architecture:
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Compose UI        │
│   (Kotlin)          │
└─────────┬───────────┘
          │ Direct calls
          │ (~0ms overhead)
┌─────────▼───────────┐
│   Termux Core       │
│   (Java/Kotlin)     │
└─────────────────────┘

- Single language context
- Zero serialization
- Standard Android debugging
- Proven native patterns
```

**5. Distribution & Ecosystem Alignment**
- **F-Droid users**: Prefer native Android apps for dev tools
- **React Native in F-Droid**: Less common, larger APK (~50MB vs ~25MB)
- **Developer audience**: Values native performance and open source transparency
- **Jetpack Compose**: Better fit for terminal emulator category

**6. iOS Uncertainty**
- Original requirement: "Android-first, **maybe** iOS later"
- iOS port is uncertain and not a 12-month goal
- Trading proven Android patterns for speculative cross-platform benefit = poor trade-off
- If iOS becomes necessary: Can rebuild UI in SwiftUI (similar effort to maintaining RN iOS)

**Decision rationale:**

**Why Jetpack Compose wins:**
1. ✅ **Direct Termux integration** - Same language, zero overhead, proven patterns
2. ✅ **Interactive terminal performance** - Native feel for vim, htop, etc.
3. ✅ **Simpler architecture** - One language, direct calls, easier debugging
4. ✅ **F-Droid ecosystem fit** - Native apps preferred by developer audience
5. ✅ **Future-forward** - Compose 1.9.3 is cutting-edge (60% adoption)
6. ✅ **Learning investment pays off** - Kotlin skills needed anyway for Termux
7. ✅ **Lower risk** - Proven patterns vs pioneering uncharted integration

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- ⚠️ Higher initial learning curve (3-4 weeks for Compose + Kotlin basics)
- ⚠️ Android-only (no iOS path without complete rewrite)
- ⚠️ Team doesn't leverage existing React expertise immediately
- ✅ But: Investment in native Android skills aligns with product focus
- ✅ Compose's declarative model feels familiar to React developers
- ✅ Long-term maintainability and performance justify the learning investment

**Alternatives considered and rejected:**

**React Native + TurboModules:**
- Familiar tech stack for team
- Potential iOS port
- BUT: No proven Termux integration, bridge overhead, architectural complexity

**Hybrid approach (RN UI + WebView terminal):**
- React Native for command blocks
- WebView + xterm.js for traditional terminal
- BUT: Two rendering engines, memory overhead, added complexity

**Flutter + Platform Channels:**
- True cross-platform
- BUT: New language (Dart), similar bridge issues, smaller ecosystem

**Conclusion:** After thorough analysis including current 2025 state of both React Native and Jetpack Compose, we reaffirm that **Jetpack Compose is the correct architectural choice** for ConvoCLI. The decision prioritizes proven patterns, native performance, and ecosystem alignment over short-term team familiarity.

**Timeline impact:** Decision confirmed before significant development started, avoiding costly mid-project pivot.

**Risk mitigation:** Analysis documented for future reference if circumstances change (e.g., iOS becomes critical requirement).

### Decision 11: Git Branching Strategy (Sprint-Based Development)

**What we decided:** Implement a modified Git Flow strategy with sprint integration branches to support iterative development and SpecSwarm workflow automation.

**Branch structure:**
- **main**: Production code (PR required post-launch)
- **develop**: Final tested integration branch (PR required post-launch)
- **sprint-##**: Sprint integration and testing (kept for history)
- **feature-***: Active feature development

**Workflow:**
```
feature-xyz → sprint-## → develop → main
```

**Why this structure:**

**1. Sprint Integration Branches (sprint-##):**
- Provides testing ground for sprint features before develop
- Isolates sprint work from develop until validated
- Historical record of sprint completion (branches kept)
- Aligns with SpecSwarm's feature completion workflow

**2. SpecSwarm/SpecLabs Integration:**
- `/specswarm:complete` merges features to current sprint branch
- Sprint branches test multiple features together
- Quality gates before merging to develop
- Maintains develop branch stability

**3. Pre-Launch Flexibility:**
- No PR requirements during active development
- Fast iteration and experimentation
- Protection rules enforced post-launch
- Enables rapid prototyping

**Branch lifecycle:**

```
Development (Pre-Launch):
feature-command-blocks (created from sprint-01)
    ↓ /specswarm:complete
sprint-01 (integration & testing)
    ↓ manual merge after testing
develop (final validation)
    ↓ release preparation
main (tagged v1.0.0)

Production (Post-Launch):
feature-git-status (created from sprint-05)
    ↓ /specswarm:complete
sprint-05 (integration & testing)
    ↓ PR required
develop (final validation)
    ↓ PR required
main (tagged v1.2.0)

Hotfix (Post-Launch):
hotfix-android-crash (from develop)
    ↓ /specswarm:hotfix
develop (emergency fix)
    ↓ fast-track merge
main (tagged v1.2.1)
```

**SpecSwarm workflow integration:**

**Feature development:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature-command-blocks sprint-01
/specswarm:specify "Command blocks UI"
/specswarm:clarify
/specswarm:plan
/specswarm:tasks
/specswarm:implement
/specswarm:complete  # Merges to sprint-01
```

**Sprint completion:**
```bash
# After all features tested in sprint
/specswarm:analyze-quality
git checkout develop
git merge sprint-01 --no-ff
git tag sprint-01-complete
```

**Release:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge develop --no-ff
git tag v1.0.0
```

**Why this aligns with ConvoCLI development:**

1. **Sprint-based roadmap**: Spec defines Month 1-3 MVP with distinct sprint goals
2. **Parallel feature development**: SpecLabs orchestration benefits from sprint isolation
3. **Quality gates**: `/specswarm:analyze-quality` at sprint boundaries ensures stability
4. **Historical tracking**: Kept sprint branches document development journey
5. **Flexible scaling**: Easy to add more sprints as project grows

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ More branches to manage than simple Git Flow
- ⚠️ Requires discipline to keep sprint branches clean
- ⚠️ Sprint merges to develop need coordination
- ✅ But: Better isolation and testing before develop
- ✅ Historical sprint records valuable for retrospectives
- ✅ SpecSwarm integration is seamless

**Alternatives considered:**

**GitHub Flow (main + feature):**
- Simpler, fewer branches
- Rejected: Too simple for 12-month sprint-based development
- No intermediate testing ground
- Harder to coordinate multiple features

**Standard Git Flow (main + develop + release + feature + hotfix):**
- Industry standard, well-documented
- Rejected: Release branches don't fit sprint model
- Doesn't integrate naturally with SpecSwarm complete workflow
- More complex than needed for pre-1.0 project

**Trunk-based Development:**
- Very fast, minimal branching
- Rejected: Requires mature CI/CD and feature flags
- Not appropriate for MVP phase
- Too risky for 1-person team initially

**Commit convention:**
Follow Conventional Commits for changelog generation:
```
feat(blocks): add swipe gesture support
fix(terminal): resolve PTY buffer overflow
docs(claude): add git workflow documentation
refactor(state): migrate to MVI pattern
test(gestures): add multi-touch integration tests
chore(deps): update Compose BOM to 2025.10.00
```

**Branch naming:**
- Features: `feature-command-blocks`, `feature-git-integration`
- Sprints: `sprint-01`, `sprint-02`, `sprint-03`
- Hotfixes: `hotfix-android-14-crash`, `hotfix-session-leak`
- Use kebab-case, descriptive but concise

**Post-launch protection:**

Once v1.0.0 is released:
- **main**: Require 1+ PR reviews, all checks pass, no force push
- **develop**: Require 1+ PR reviews, all checks pass, no force push
- **sprint-##**: Optional protection (team discretion)
- **feature-***: No protection (deleted after merge)

**Timeline impact:**
- Sprint branches enable parallel feature development
- `/specswarm:complete` automation reduces merge overhead
- Quality gates prevent rework (catch issues at sprint level)
- Expected to maintain 2-3 week sprint cadence

**Risk mitigation:**
- Git hooks enforce commit conventions
- Branch protection prevents accidental force pushes
- Sprint tags preserve history even if branches deleted
- Clear documentation prevents workflow confusion

## Branding & Naming

### Official Name: ConvoCLI

**What we decided:** The official product name is **ConvoCLI** (pronounced "convo CLI").

**Why:**
- **Outcome-focused:** Emphasizes conversational interaction paradigm that users already understand from AI coding tools (Claude Code uses "conversations", ChatGPT uses "chats")
- **Clear positioning:** "Convo" = conversational interface, "CLI" = command-line tool
- **Product family potential:** Sets up clean namespace for future products (ConvoSync, ConvoBlocks, etc.)
- **Short and memorable:** 8 characters, easy to type and say
- **Unique:** Distinguishes from mechanism-focused names like "terminal" or "shell"
- **Developer-friendly:** CLI suffix signals technical tool for developers

**Naming Journey:**
We explored several naming directions:
1. **Mechanism names** (what it IS): converseshell, dialogueshell, shellconvo - rejected as clunky
2. **Outcome names** (what you GET): pocketterm, pocketcli, mobilecli - good but generic
3. **Inspiration names** (emotional WHY): sparkcli, flashcli, flowcli - compelling but not core identity
4. **Conversation family** (aligns with AI tools): convocli, convoterm - WINNER

**Final decision rationale:**
- Users already think in "conversations" when using AI coding tools
- ConvoCLI bridges familiar AI tool paradigm to mobile CLI access
- "Convo" is widely understood shorthand for "conversation"
- Product family strategy enables clear brand extension

### Domain Portfolio

**Registered Domains:**
- ✅ **convocli.com** (~$13/year) - Main product website, marketing, downloads
- ✅ **convocli.dev** (~$13/year) - Developer documentation, API reference, CLI installation
- ✅ **convocli.app** (~$13/year) - Alternative/redirect domain

**Future Domains (to be registered):**
- 📋 **convosync.dev** (~$13/year) - To be registered when cross-device sync feature is ready for implementation (Phase 2, Month 4-6)

**Total Domain Cost:** ~$39/year (all registered) + $13/year for ConvoSync when ready

**Domain Strategy:**
- Use .com for consumer-facing brand (main website)
- Use .dev for developer-facing resources (matches GitHub.dev, Deno.dev pattern)
- Use .app for app-specific landing/redirect
- Use .dev for feature products (convosync.dev) to signal technical/developer focus

**Rejected Premium TLDs:**
- ❌ .sh domains ($90-100/year) - Too expensive for vanity
- ❌ .ai domains ($90-100/year) - Not positioning as AI-first, premium not justified
- ✅ .dev provides same developer credibility at 87% cost savings

### Product Family Vision

**Core Products:**
```
Convo
├── ConvoCLI (convocli.com)
│   ├── Docs (convocli.dev)
│   └── App (convocli.app)
└── ConvoSync (convosync.dev) [Future: Phase 2]
```

**Potential Future Expansions:**
- ConvoBlocks - Command blocks marketplace/sharing
- ConvoPro - Professional tier branding
- ConvoHub - Community/plugin ecosystem

**Brand Voice:**
- "ConvoCLI - The conversational CLI for mobile developers"
- "Have conversations with your command line, anywhere"
- "Code from your pocket with ConvoCLI"

### Key Branding Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Product name** | ConvoCLI | Aligns with AI tool paradigm, enables product family |
| **Primary domain** | convocli.com | Main brand presence |
| **Developer docs** | convocli.dev | Developer-friendly TLD at low cost |
| **Sync feature** | convosync.dev | Dedicated domain for killer feature |
| **TLD strategy** | .com + .dev (not .sh/.ai) | 87% cost savings without credibility loss |
| **Brand family** | Convo + [Feature] | Clean namespace for expansion |

- PTY (pseudo-terminal) interface
- Package management (apt)
- No root required

Key libraries:
- `terminal-view` (v0.118.0) - Terminal widget
- `terminal-emulator` - Emulation logic
- Available on JitPack: `com.termux.termux-app:terminal-view:0.118.0`

**How Termux Works:**
- Operates entirely in user space (/data/data/com.termux/files/)
- Packages cross-compiled with Android NDK for ARM/AARCH64
- Uses apt package manager (Debian/Ubuntu style)
- No kernel modifications required

#### 2. Modern UI Framework: Jetpack Compose

**Why Jetpack Compose?**
- Modern declarative UI (60% of top 1000 apps in 2025)
- Perfect for chat-like interfaces
- Material Design 3 with dynamic theming
- Excellent performance
- Native Android

**Key Features:**

    val id: UUID,
    val command: String,
    val output: String,
    val exitStatus: ExitStatus,
    val timestamp: Instant,
    val metadata: BlockMetadata
)

enum class ExitStatus {
    SUCCESS,
    ERROR,
    RUNNING
}
```

**Features:**
- Each command + output is an atomic "card"
- Visual status indicators (success/error)
- Swipe actions (copy, share, re-run)
- Syntax highlighting
- Markdown rendering for output

#### 4. Conversational Input Interface

**Design Principles:**
- Chat bubble for commands (user messages)
- Response blocks for output (assistant messages)
- Inline code highlighting
- Auto-complete suggestions
- Natural language command assistance (optional AI)

**UI Components:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun ConversationalTerminal() {
    LazyColumn {
        items(commandBlocks) { block ->
            CommandCard(
                command = block.command,
                output = block.output.toAnnotatedString(),
                status = block.exitStatus
            )
        }
    }
    ConversationalInput(
        onCommand = { handleCommand(it) }
    )
}
```

### Flow 5: Cross-Device Session Sync (Killer Feature)

**Goal:** Seamlessly continue Claude Code conversations across devices.

**Scenario:** Developer starts work on desktop, continues on Android

```
=== ON DESKTOP (Any OS) ===

1. Developer uses Claude Code on desktop
   Desktop Terminal:
   $ claude-code "Build user authentication API"
   Claude: I'll create the authentication system...
   [Creates files, implements features]

   Session: ~/.claude/projects/my-app/session_abc123.jsonl
   Contains: 47 messages, full context

2. Convo syncs session automatically
   └→ Desktop Convo client detects new Claude Code session
   └→ Uploads to Convo Cloud (E2E encrypted)
   └→ Real-time sync to all devices

=== ON ANDROID (Convo App) ===

3. Developer opens Convo on phone (10 mins later)
   └→ Notification: "Desktop session synced ✅"

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🔄 Synced Sessions          │
   ├─────────────────────────────┤

   │    [Browse All]             │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

4. User taps [Continue]
   └→ Full session loads with context

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ 💬 User Auth API Session    │
   │ 💻 Started on Desktop       │

   ├─────────────────────────────┤
   │ [Your message...]     [▶]  │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

5. User continues conversation
   User: "Now add mobile OAuth login"
   Claude: "I'll add OAuth support for Google and Apple.
           Based on the API I just created..."

   ✅ FULL CONTEXT PRESERVED!
   └→ Claude remembers all previous work
   └→ References files created on desktop
   └→ Understands project structure

6. Changes sync back to desktop
   └→ Android session updates upload to cloud
   └→ Desktop Claude Code sees continuation
   └→ Developer can pick up on desktop again
```

**Sync Flow Details:**

```
Desktop → Cloud:
1. Detect new/updated Claude Code session files
2. Parse JSONL format
3. Encrypt with user's key (E2E)
4. Upload to Convo Cloud API
5. Notify other devices via WebSocket

Cloud → Android:
1. Receive sync notification
2. Download encrypted session
3. Decrypt locally (zero-knowledge)
4. Import into local Convo session
5. Display in "Synced Sessions" list
6. Ready to continue instantly
```

**Key UX Elements:**
- **Automatic:** No manual export/import
- **Fast:** Sessions appear in <5 seconds
- **Secure:** E2E encrypted, user controls keys
- **Offline-first:** Local copy, syncs when online
- **Conflict resolution:** UI for manual merging if needed

---

### Flow 6: AI Error Explanation (Beginner-Friendly)

**Goal:** Help users understand and fix errors without googling.

```
1. User runs command that fails
   User: npm install

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ 💭 You                     │
   │ npm install                 │

   └→ Fills in commit message
   └→ All 6 steps execute automatically
   └→ Time saved: ~2 minutes
```

---

### Flow 8: Background Command Execution (Mobile Advantage)

**Goal:** Long-running commands continue even when app is closed.

```
1. User starts long-running command
   User: npm install   (300+ packages, 10+ minutes)

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🤖 Terminal                │
   │ ⏳ Running... 3s            │
   │                             │
   │ npm http fetch GET 200...   │
   │ [output streaming]          │
   └─────────────────────────────┘

2. System detects long-running command
   └→ Notification appears

   📱 Notification:
   "npm install is running in background"
   [Tap to view] [Stop]

3. User switches to browser
   └→ Convo moves to background
   └→ Foreground Service keeps command running
   └→ Notification shows progress

4. 10 minutes later...
   └→ Command completes
   └→ Notification updates

   📱 Notification:
   "npm install completed ✅ (10m 32s)"
   [View output]

5. User taps notification
   └→ Returns to Convo
   └→ Full output visible

   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🤖 Terminal                │
   │ ✅ Success • 10m 32s        │
   │                             │
   │ added 847 packages in 10m   │
   │ 123 packages are looking... │
   │                             │
   │ [Copy] [Share]              │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Background Execution Features:**
- Foreground Service (Android)
- Real-time progress in notification
- Can stop from notification
- Full output preserved

---

## Key UX Principles

Throughout all flows, Convo follows these design principles:

### 1. **Conversational**
- Commands feel like messages
- Terminal "responds" like an assistant
- Natural back-and-forth flow

### 2. **Touch-First**
- Large touch targets (48x48dp minimum)
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Haptic feedback for all interactions
- Mobile-optimized layouts

### 3. **Discoverable**

- Consistent visual language

### 6. **Fast**
- <100ms command latency
- Instant search results
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background sync

---

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Bridging Terminal Output to Compose

**Challenge:** Terminal emulators use custom views with direct canvas drawing. We need to convert this to Compose.

**Solution:**
```kotlin
class CommandBlockManager(
    private val terminalSession: TerminalSession
) {
    private val _blocks = MutableStateFlow<List<CommandBlock>>(emptyList())
    val blocks: StateFlow<List<CommandBlock>> = _blocks.asStateFlow()

    init {
        // Listen to terminal output
        terminalSession.addOutputListener { output ->
            updateCurrentBlock(output)
        }

        // Detect command completion
        terminalSession.addPromptListener {
            finalizeCurrentBlock()
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. ANSI Escape Sequence Parsing

**Challenge:** Convert ANSI color codes and formatting to Compose AnnotatedString.

**Solution:**
```kotlin
fun String.toAnnotatedString(): AnnotatedString {
    return buildAnnotatedString {
        var index = 0
        val ansiPattern = "\u001B\\[[0-9;]*m".toRegex()

        ansiPattern.findAll(this@toAnnotatedString).forEach { match ->
            // Add text before escape sequence
            append(substring(index, match.range.first))

            // Parse escape sequence
            val code = match.value
            val style = parseAnsiCode(code)

            // Apply style to subsequent text
            pushStyle(style)

            index = match.range.last + 1
        }

        // Add remaining text
        append(substring(index))
    }
}
```

### 3. Command Detection

**Challenge:** Detect when user enters a command vs when it's still typing.

**Solution:**
```kotlin
TextField(
    value = input,
    onValueChange = { input = it },
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(
        imeAction = ImeAction.Done
    ),
    keyboardActions = KeyboardActions(
        onDone = {
            createNewCommandBlock(input)
            terminalSession.write("$input\n")
            input = ""
        }
    )
)
```

### 4. Block Actions

**Swipe to Reveal Actions:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun CommandCard(block: CommandBlock) {
    val swipeState = rememberSwipeableState(0)

    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .swipeable(
                state = swipeState,
                anchors = mapOf(0f to 0, -300f to 1),
                thresholds = { _, _ -> FractionalThreshold(0.3f) }
            )
    ) {
        // Actions revealed on swipe
        Row {
            IconButton(onClick = { copyToClipboard(block.output) }) {
                Icon(Icons.Default.ContentCopy)
            }
            IconButton(onClick = { reRunCommand(block.command) }) {
                Icon(Icons.Default.Refresh)
            }
            IconButton(onClick = { shareBlock(block) }) {
                Icon(Icons.Default.Share)
            }
        }

        // Command card
        CommandBlockContent(block)
    }
}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: ANSI Parsing to Compose
**Problem:** Terminal output contains ANSI escape sequences that need to be converted to Compose styling.

**Solution:**
- Build ANSI parser that converts to AnnotatedString
- Cache parsed output for performance
- Support common color schemes
- Handle edge cases (ncurses, progress bars)

### Challenge 2: Performance with Large Outputs
**Problem:** Commands like `cat large_file.txt` could generate thousands of lines.

**Solution:**
- Implement output pagination within blocks
- "Show more/less" toggles
- Virtual scrolling with LazyColumn
- Limit stored history (configurable)

### Challenge 3: PTY Compatibility
**Problem:** Some programs (vim, htop) require full terminal control.

**Solution:**
- Detect full-screen apps (ncurses)
- Switch to traditional terminal view
- Smooth transition back to blocks mode
- Allow users to choose default behavior

### Challenge 4: Interactive Programs
**Problem:** Programs expecting real-time input (REPL, ssh).

**Solution:**
- Detect interactive mode
- Enable streaming input
- Show "live" block that updates in real-time
- Finalize block when program exits

### Challenge 5: Play Store Distribution
**Problem:** Google Play restricts apps targeting API < 34 and has restrictions on terminal emulators.

**Solution:**
- Target API 34+
- Primary distribution via F-Droid (recommended for FOSS)
- GitHub releases with APK
- Document Play Store submission process
- Consider Termux's approach (they moved to F-Droid)

## Licensing & Distribution

### License: GPLv3
**Why GPLv3?**
- Termux is GPLv3, so derivatives must be too
- Ensures project remains open source

The project is:
- ✅ **Legally viable** (GPLv3, no licensing issues)
- ✅ **Technically achievable** (3-4 months solo, proven technologies)
- ✅ **Market ready** (clear differentiation, growing mobile dev community)
- ✅ **Open source** (can benefit entire Android ecosystem)

This isn't just a Termux clone with a new coat of paint—it's a reimagining of what a mobile terminal can be, making powerful command-line tools like Claude Code, git, npm, and thousands of others accessible to a broader audience through thoughtful UX design.
