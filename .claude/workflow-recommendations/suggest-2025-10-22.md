## Primary Recommendation: Feature Development

### Score Breakdown (18/20)

**Evidence:**
- ‚úÖ Roadmap explicitly plans Feature 003 next (+5 points)
- ‚úÖ Quality analysis complete (foundation validated) (+3 points)
- ‚úÖ Previous feature just merged (ready for next) (+3 points)
- ‚úÖ Main branch stable (+2 points)

### Why This Feature?

**Feature 003: Termux Bootstrap Installation**

**Purpose**: Install the Termux bootstrap system (~70MB) to enable ACTUAL Linux command execution

**Critical Path Status**: üî• **BLOCKING ALL OTHER DEVELOPMENT**

**Why It's Critical**:
- Feature 002 built terminal infrastructure but NO bash executable exists
- All integration tests are "infrastructure ready" but can't execute real commands
- UI development (Features 005-006) BLOCKED without this
- Package management (Feature 004) BLOCKED without this
- Project cannot achieve MVP status without working commands

**Impact When Complete**:
- ‚úÖ Unblocks Feature 004 (Package Management)
- ‚úÖ Unblocks Feature 005 (Command Blocks UI)
- ‚úÖ Unblocks Feature 006 (Traditional Terminal Mode)
- ‚úÖ All integration tests execute with real commands
- ‚úÖ Project becomes actually usable (MVP milestone)

## Alternative Workflows (Not Recommended)

### Alternative 1: Quality Improvements (Refactor)

**Score**: 5/20 (25%)
**Confidence**: LOW-MEDIUM

**When to Use**: After Feature 003 unblocks development

**Evidence**:
- Quality analysis found test coverage gaps (43.5%)
- Score 78/100 suggests room for improvement
- Architecture scored 100/100 (perfect, no refactoring needed)

**Why Not Now**:
- Roadmap prioritizes Feature 003 as CRITICAL PATH
- Test improvements are MEDIUM priority (not blocking)
- Better to unblock development first, then improve quality
- Scheduled for Week 2 per roadmap

**Decision**: ‚ùå Not recommended now. Address after Feature 003.

---

### Alternative 2: Bug Fixing

**Score**: 2/20 (10%)
**Confidence**: VERY LOW

**When to Use**: If bugs discovered during testing

**Evidence**:
- Recent commits had some fixes (all resolved)
- Quality analysis found NO critical issues
- Build successful, tests passing

**Decision**: ‚ùå No bugs to fix currently.

---

## Alignment Analysis

| Source | Recommendation | Alignment |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Roadmap** | "Feature 003 next" | ‚úÖ ALIGNED |
| **Quality Analysis** | "Foundation is solid, proceed" | ‚úÖ ALIGNED |
| **Git History** | "Previous feature complete" | ‚úÖ ALIGNED |
| **Blockers** | "None identified" | ‚úÖ ALIGNED |

**Conclusion**: All indicators point to proceeding with Feature 003.

---

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Bootstrap Size & Storage

- **Archive Size**: ~70MB download
- **Extracted Size**: ~150MB
- **Storage Planning**: Ensure sufficient space
- **Download Strategy**: Consider chunked download for reliability
- **Progress UI**: Show download/extraction progress to user

### 2. Permissions & Security

- **Execute Permissions**: Required for bash and utilities
- **Android Storage**: May need runtime permissions
- **API Compatibility**: Test on Android API 26+ (minSdk)
- **Security**: Verify bootstrap archive integrity (checksums)

### 3. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- Bootstrap download logic
- Archive extraction
- Permission setting
- Error handling

**Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end bootstrap installation
- File system operations
- Permission verification

**Validation Tests**:
- Execute real bash commands
- Verify all previous integration tests pass with real commands
- Test core utilities (ls, cat, grep, etc.)

### 4. Error Handling & Rollback

**Graceful Degradation**:
- If bootstrap fails, show helpful error message
- Allow retry mechanism
- Don't crash app on failure

**User Communication**:
- Clear progress indicators
- Informative error messages
- Troubleshooting guidance

---

## Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Start Feature Specification

**Command**:
```bash
/specswarm:specify "Feature 003 - Termux Bootstrap Installation"
```

**What to Provide** (when prompted):

```
Feature Name: Termux Bootstrap Installation

Description:
Install the Termux bootstrap system to enable Linux command execution
in the ConvoCLI terminal. This includes downloading the bootstrap archive
from the Termux repository, extracting it to the app's files directory,
configuring file permissions, setting up environment variables, and
verifying that bash and core utilities are functional.

Context:
- Feature 002 provides terminal infrastructure (PTY, sessions, UI) but no executables
- Integration tests are "infrastructure ready" but cannot execute real commands
- This is the critical path blocking all UI development (Features 005-006)
- This is the critical path blocking package management (Feature 004)
- Based on Termux's official bootstrap installation mechanism
- Bootstrap provides: bash, coreutils, apt, dpkg, and base Linux environment

Technical Requirements:
- Download bootstrap archive (~70MB) from Termux repository
- Verify archive integrity (checksums)
- Extract to app's private files directory
- Set execute permissions on binaries
- Configure PREFIX and other environment variables
- Verify bash executable works
- Update integration tests to use real commands

Success Criteria:
- Bootstrap installed successfully
- bash --version returns version info
- ls, cat, grep work correctly
- All integration tests pass with real command execution
- Error handling for network issues, storage issues, permission issues
```

### Step 2: Follow the Guided Workflow

After `/specswarm:specify`, the SpecSwarm workflow will guide you through each step with clear instructions and success criteria.
