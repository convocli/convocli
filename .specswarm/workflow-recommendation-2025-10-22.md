## üéØ Primary Recommendation: `/specswarm:specify`

**Confidence**: ‚úÖ **VERY HIGH (95%)**

### Reasoning:

1. **Clean Development State**
   - On `main` branch (all features merged and stable)
   - No active feature branches
   - Infrastructure complete (Features 001-003)
   - Ready for next feature

2. **Quality Analysis Validates Need**
   - Critical gap identified: UI Layer Missing
   - Score: 40/100 for UI module (only theme files exist)
   - Quote: "The defining product feature doesn't exist yet"
   - Next milestone: Command Blocks UI (Week 3-4)

3. **Roadmap Alignment**
   - Current: End of Month 1, Week 2 (Project Setup complete)
   - Next: Month 1, Week 3-4 (Basic Block UI)
   - Feature: Command Blocks UI - THE defining product differentiator
   - Timeline: 2-3 days per roadmap

4. **Project Phase**
   - Phase: MVP Foundation (Month 1-3)
   - Status: Infrastructure ‚úì, Experience ‚úó
   - Need: Shift from infrastructure to user experience
   - Impact: Make-or-break feature for product vision

5. **Git Workflow Pattern**
   - Pattern: feature-001 ‚Üí sprint-01 ‚Üí main (complete)
   - Pattern: feature-002 ‚Üí sprint-01 ‚Üí main (complete)
   - Pattern: feature-003 ‚Üí sprint-01 ‚Üí main (complete)
   - Next: feature-004 ‚Üí sprint-01 ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main

### Why This Workflow:

**`/specswarm:specify`** is the correct starting point for new feature development:

1. **Creates Specification** - Defines the Command Blocks UI feature
2. **Clarification Phase** - Asks 3-5 targeted questions to resolve ambiguities
3. **Planning Phase** - Generates implementation plan
4. **Task Generation** - Creates executable tasks
5. **Implementation** - Guides through development
6. **Completion** - Merges to sprint-01 branch

This workflow ensures:
- ‚úÖ Feature is well-specified before implementation
- ‚úÖ Ambiguities resolved upfront
- ‚úÖ Implementation plan validated
- ‚úÖ Tasks are actionable and dependency-ordered
- ‚úÖ Quality gates at each phase

### Expected Outcome:

After completing this workflow, you'll have:

1. **Specification Document** (`features/004-command-blocks-ui/spec.md`)
   - Feature goals and user stories
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - UI/UX specifications

2. **Implementation Plan** (`features/004-command-blocks-ui/plan.md`)
   - Architecture decisions
   - Component breakdown
   - Data models
   - Integration points with Features 002-003

3. **Executable Tasks** (`features/004-command-blocks-ui/tasks.md`)
   - Dependency-ordered task list
   - T001-T0XX with estimates
   - Phase-based organization
   - Testing strategy

4. **Working Feature**
   - CommandBlock data structure
   - CommandBlockManager (bridge Termux ‚Üí Compose)
   - CommandBlocksScreen composable
   - LazyColumn with Material 3 Cards
   - Merged to `sprint-01` branch

5. **Quality Increase**
   - Overall score: 58 ‚Üí 75/100
   - UI module: 40 ‚Üí 80/100
   - Product vision validated ‚úì

## Alternative Workflows

### ‚ùå Alternative 1: `/specswarm:bugfix`
**Confidence**: Very Low (5%)
**When to Use**: When fixing broken functionality
**Why Not Now**:
- No bugs reported
- Recent commits show stable features
- Quality analysis found no critical bugs
- Only 4 deferred TODOs (intentional technical debt)

### ‚ùå Alternative 2: `/specswarm:modify`
**Confidence**: Very Low (5%)
**When to Use**: When adding features to existing functionality
**Why Not Now**:
- No existing UI to modify
- This is net-new functionality, not enhancement
- Command Blocks UI doesn't exist yet

### ‚ùå Alternative 3: `/specswarm:refactor`
**Confidence**: Low (10%)
**When to Use**: When improving code quality without changing functionality
**Why Not Now**:
- Code quality is already good (documentation 98%, architecture sound)
- Better to implement UI first, then refactor if needed
- Test coverage can improve alongside new features

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Alternative 4: Write Tests First
**Confidence**: Medium (30%)
**When to Use**: When test coverage is critically low
**Why Consider**:
- Current test coverage: 29% (12/41 files)
- Bootstrap module: 0% coverage
- Terminal repository: Untested
**Why Not Now**:
- Tests are important but not blocking
- UI implementation is higher priority (validates product)
- Can add tests alongside UI development
- Quality analysis recommends: Critical first, High second

---

## Not Recommended

### ‚ùå Manual UI Development (Without SpecSwarm)
**Why Not**:
- SpecSwarm provides structure and quality gates
- Ensures feature is well-specified
- Prevents scope creep
- Tracks progress systematically
- Aligns with project's workflow standards

### ‚ùå Implementing Multiple Features in Parallel
**Why Not**:
- Command Blocks UI is foundational for other features
- Chat Input depends on block structure
- Touch Gestures enhance blocks
- Sequential development reduces integration risk

---

## Recommended Feature Specification

Based on the roadmap and quality analysis, here's the recommended feature to specify:

### Feature: Command Blocks UI

**Description**:
Implement the conversational terminal interface with Material 3 cards that display command input/output as chat-like blocks. This is the core differentiator that transforms ConvoCLI from a generic terminal to "Warp 2.0 for Android."

**User Story**:
"As a mobile developer, I want to see my terminal commands and output displayed as discrete, chat-like cards so that I can easily read, scroll, and interact with command history on my phone."

**Key Components** (from roadmap Week 3-4):
1. CommandBlock data structure
2. CommandBlockManager to bridge Termux ‚Üí Compose
3. Basic LazyColumn with Card composables
4. Prompt detection for command boundaries
5. Basic ANSI parsing for colored output
6. Simple status indicators (success/error/running)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can execute commands via terminal
- Commands appear as discrete cards
- Output displays within cards
- Cards are scrollable
- Material 3 theming applied
- 60fps UI performance

**Integration Points**:
- Feature 002: TermuxTerminalRepository (command execution)
- Feature 003: Bootstrap (Linux environment)
- Existing TerminalViewModel (state management)

**Timeline**: 2-3 days (per roadmap)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. ‚úÖ **Review this recommendation**
   - Understand why feature development is recommended
   - Review the proposed feature specification
   - Confirm alignment with roadmap

2. üéØ **Start Feature Development Workflow**
   ```bash
   /specswarm:specify "Command Blocks UI - Conversational terminal interface with Material 3 cards displaying command input/output as chat-like blocks"
   ```

3. üìã **Answer Clarification Questions**
   - SpecSwarm will ask 3-5 targeted questions
   - Provide specific answers to resolve ambiguities
   - This ensures the spec is unambiguous

4. üìê **Review Generated Plan**
   - SpecSwarm will generate implementation plan
   - Validate architecture decisions
   - Confirm component breakdown

5. ‚úÖ **Generate Tasks**
   ```bash
   /specswarm:tasks
   ```

6. üöÄ **Implement Feature**
   ```bash
   /specswarm:implement
   ```

7. üîÑ **Complete and Merge**
   ```bash
   /specswarm:complete  # Merges to sprint-01
   ```

### Alternative Path (If You Want to Fix Tests First):

```bash
# Option A: Quick wins (2 min + 3-4 hours)
1. Fix null safety issue (BootstrapValidatorImpl.kt:185)
2. Add Bootstrap module tests

# Then proceed to UI:
/specswarm:specify "Command Blocks UI"
```

---

## Full Workflow Sequence

Here's the complete sequence for implementing Command Blocks UI:

```bash
# 1. Specify the feature
/specswarm:specify "Command Blocks UI - Conversational terminal interface with Material 3 cards displaying command input/output as chat-like blocks"

# 2. Clarify ambiguities (interactive)
/specswarm:clarify

# 3. Generate implementation plan
/specswarm:plan

# 4. Generate executable tasks
/specswarm:tasks

# 5. Implement the feature
/specswarm:implement

# 6. Validate quality
/specswarm:analyze-quality

# 7. Complete and merge to sprint-01
/specswarm:complete

# 8. Validate sprint
git checkout sprint-01
/speclabs:orchestrate-validate /home/marty/code-projects/convocli

# 9. Merge to develop (after testing)
git checkout develop
git merge sprint-01 --no-ff -m "Sprint 01: Command Blocks UI"
```

## Command to Run

**Primary Recommendation**:
```bash
/specswarm:specify "Command Blocks UI - Conversational terminal interface with Material 3 cards displaying command input/output as chat-like blocks"
```

**Alternative** (if you want to see detailed feature template first):
```bash
/specswarm:specify  # Without arguments - will prompt for details
```

- ‚úÖ No active feature branches or bugs blocking
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure complete and stable

**Risk Factors**: None identified

**Alternative Considerations**:
- Test coverage could be improved (29% ‚Üí 65%)
- But UI implementation is higher priority
- Tests can be added alongside or after UI
