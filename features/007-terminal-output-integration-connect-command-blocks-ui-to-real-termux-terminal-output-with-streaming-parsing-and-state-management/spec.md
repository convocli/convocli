# Feature 007: Terminal Output Integration

**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Sprint**: Sprint 02

---

## Overview

Connect the Command Blocks UI (built in Feature 004) to the real terminal emulator core (built in Feature 002) to replace simulated output with actual command execution results. Users will see real-time terminal output stream into command blocks as commands execute, with proper formatting, color preservation, and state management.

**Current State**: Command Blocks UI displays simulated output for demonstration purposes.

**Desired State**: Command Blocks display actual terminal output from executed commands with real-time streaming and proper terminal formatting.

**Business Value**: Transforms the app from a UI mockup into a functional terminal emulator with conversational interface.

---

## User Scenarios

### Primary Flow: Execute Command with Real Output

**Actor**: Mobile developer using ConvoCLI

**Scenario**:
1. User types `ls -la` in the command input bar
2. User taps the send button
3. A new command block appears with "Executing..." status
4. Terminal output streams into the block in real-time as it's generated
5. Colors and formatting are preserved (green for directories, etc.)
6. When the command completes (prompt returns), block status changes to "Completed"
7. User sees the final output with proper formatting

**Expected Experience**:
- Output appears instantly as terminal generates it (no buffering delay)
- ANSI colors render correctly in the UI
- User can see progress for long-running commands
- Command completion is automatically detected

### Secondary Flow: Long-Running Command with Streaming

**Scenario**:
1. User executes `npm install` (takes 30 seconds)
2. Command block shows "Executing..." status
3. Output streams in real-time: package download progress, installation messages
4. User sees the block's content growing as output arrives
5. User can scroll through partial output while command runs
6. When complete, block shows "Success" status and full output

### Edge Case: Command with Errors

**Scenario**:
1. User executes `cat nonexistent.txt`
2. Command block appears with "Executing..." status
3. Error message streams to output: "cat: nonexistent.txt: No such file or directory"
4. Command completes with non-zero exit code
5. Block status changes to "Failed" (red indicator)
6. Error output is clearly visible to user

### Edge Case: Canceled Command

**Scenario**:
1. User executes long-running command `ping google.com`
2. Output streams continuously
3. User taps cancel button on the command block
4. Terminal process is terminated
5. Block status changes to "Canceled"
6. Partial output remains visible
7. User can re-run the command if needed

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Real Terminal Output Capture
The system shall capture output from the terminal emulator's execution engine and route it to the appropriate command block in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Output appears in command blocks within 50ms of being generated by terminal
- Both standard output and error output are captured
- Output from different commands does not mix or overlap
- Binary output is handled gracefully (non-printable characters)

### FR2: Real-Time Output Streaming
The system shall stream terminal output to command blocks incrementally as it arrives, not waiting for command completion.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users see output appear progressively for long-running commands
- UI remains responsive while output streams (no blocking)
- Streaming stops cleanly when command completes
- Maximum latency from terminal generation to UI display is 100ms

### FR3: ANSI Color Code Preservation
The system shall preserve and render ANSI color codes from terminal output in the command block display.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Colored output (e.g., `ls` with colors) displays with correct colors in UI
- Standard ANSI color codes (30-37, 90-97 for foreground) are supported
- Background colors are rendered if present in output
- Bold, underline, and other text formatting is preserved
- Invalid or unsupported escape sequences are stripped cleanly

### FR4: Command Completion Detection
The system shall automatically detect when a command has finished executing based on prompt pattern recognition.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System recognizes standard shell prompts (e.g., "$ ", "# ", "user@host:~$ ")
- Command block status updates to "Completed" when prompt detected
- Detection works for common shells (bash, sh, zsh)
- Custom prompts will be supported via pre-configured patterns (bash, zsh, sh defaults) in Sprint 02, with user-configurable patterns planned for future enhancement
- False positives (prompt-like output mid-command) do not trigger completion

### FR5: Command Exit Status Handling
The system shall capture and display command exit status to differentiate successful completion from failures.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Successful commands (exit code 0) show "Success" status with green indicator
- Failed commands (non-zero exit code) show "Failed" status with red indicator
- Exit code is available for debugging if needed
- Status indicator is visually distinct and immediately recognizable

### FR6: Output and Error Stream Separation
The system shall distinguish between standard output (stdout) and error output (stderr) streams.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Both streams are captured and preserved
- Streams are interleaved in chronological order in command block
- Error output (stderr) is visually distinct with red text coloring to align with terminal conventions and improve error visibility
- Copy operations preserve the combined output stream order

### FR7: Session State Persistence
The system shall persist command execution state across app restarts so users don't lose their command history.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Command blocks and their output survive app background/foreground cycles
- Command history persists across device restarts
- Executing commands resume or fail gracefully after app restart
- Session restore completes within 2 seconds on app launch

### FR8: Command Cancellation
The system shall allow users to cancel long-running or stuck commands.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Cancel button is available on executing commands
- Canceling sends termination signal to terminal process
- Command block status updates to "Canceled" within 500ms
- Partial output remains visible after cancellation
- Terminal session remains usable after cancellation (no corruption)

### FR9: Working Directory Tracking
The system shall track the current working directory as commands execute and display it to users.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Current directory is displayed with each command block
- Directory updates when user executes `cd` commands
- Directory persists correctly across command executions
- Working directory is displayed in each command block's header (similar to Warp's design) to provide historical context with each command

## Success Criteria

The following measurable outcomes define successful completion of this feature:

### User Experience Metrics
1. **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Users see output appear within 100ms of terminal generation for 95% of commands
2. **Visual Fidelity**: ANSI colors and formatting render correctly for 100% of standard terminal output
3. **Task Completion**: Users can successfully execute and view results for common commands (`ls`, `cat`, `git status`, `npm install`) with 100% success rate

### Performance Metrics
1. **Streaming Efficiency**: App handles continuous output streams (e.g., `tail -f`) without UI lag or memory issues for at least 10,000 lines
2. **Session Persistence**: Command history restores within 2 seconds on app launch with 100% data integrity

### Functional Metrics
1. **Command Completion Detection**: System correctly identifies command completion for 95% of commands with standard prompts
2. **Exit Status Accuracy**: Exit status (success/failure) matches actual terminal result with 100% accuracy
3. **Cancellation Reliability**: Command cancellation succeeds within 500ms for 100% of attempts

### Quality Metrics
1. **Zero Output Loss**: No terminal output is lost or corrupted during streaming
2. **Zero Cross-Contamination**: Output from concurrent commands never mixes or displays in wrong blocks

## Key Entities

### CommandBlock
Represents a single command execution in the UI with its associated output and state.

**Attributes**:
- Unique identifier
- Command text entered by user
- Execution status (Pending, Executing, Completed, Failed, Canceled)
- Combined output stream (stdout + stderr, interleaved)
- Exit code (if completed)
- Execution start time
- Execution end time (if completed)
- Working directory at time of execution
- Expansion state (collapsed/expanded for long output)

### TerminalSession
Represents an active terminal emulator session that executes commands.

**Attributes**:
- Session identifier
- Current working directory
- Environment variables
- Process state (active/inactive)
- Output stream
- Input stream
- Session creation time

### OutputChunk
Represents a fragment of terminal output as it streams in real-time.

**Attributes**:
- Chunk data (text with ANSI codes)
- Stream type (stdout/stderr)
- Timestamp
- Associated command block identifier

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Output Latency**: Maximum 100ms from terminal generation to UI display
- **Memory Efficiency**: Output streaming does not cause memory growth beyond 50MB for typical usage
- **Battery Impact**: Terminal output processing does not increase battery drain by more than 5%

### Reliability
- **Zero Data Loss**: No terminal output is lost during streaming or persistence
- **Crash Recovery**: App gracefully handles process crashes and restores session state
- **Concurrent Safety**: Multiple command executions do not interfere with each other

### Usability
- **Responsive UI**: Terminal output does not block user interactions
- **Clear Status Indicators**: Command execution state is always visually obvious
- **Accessible Output**: Users can easily scroll, copy, and search through output

---

## Assumptions

1. **Terminal Core Availability**: The terminal emulator core (Feature 002) provides reliable APIs for:
   - Executing commands
   - Capturing output streams
   - Detecting command completion
   - Sending termination signals

2. **Prompt Patterns**: Sprint 02 will support standard shell prompts via pre-configured patterns (bash, zsh, sh defaults covering 95% of users). User-configurable custom prompt patterns are planned for future enhancement.

3. **Output Volume**: Typical command output is under 10,000 lines. Very long output (e.g., `cat /dev/random`) will be truncated or paginated to prevent memory issues.

4. **ANSI Support**: We assume standard ANSI color codes (16-color palette). Extended 256-color or true-color support is out of scope for Sprint 02.

5. **Single Session**: Sprint 02 focuses on single terminal session management. Multiple concurrent sessions are planned for future sprints.

6. **stderr Handling**: stderr and stdout will be interleaved in chronological order, with stderr displayed in red text to align with terminal conventions and improve error visibility.

7. **Directory Display**: Working directory will be shown in each command block's header (similar to Warp's design pattern) to provide historical context. A persistent directory indicator is out of scope for Sprint 02.

8. **Binary Output**: Commands that produce binary output (e.g., `cat image.png`) will display a placeholder message like "[Binary output - 15KB]" instead of corrupting the display.

## Dependencies

### Feature Dependencies
- **Feature 002**: Termux Integration - Terminal emulator core must be operational
- **Feature 004**: Command Blocks UI - UI components must be available for integration

### External Dependencies
- None - All required functionality is within the existing codebase

### Data Dependencies
- Session persistence requires local storage capability
- Output streaming requires reactive data flow mechanism

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not included** in this feature:

1. **Multiple Sessions**: Managing multiple concurrent terminal sessions (planned for Sprint 03)
2. **Terminal Tabs**: Tab-based interface for switching between sessions
3. **Output Filtering**: Search or filter terminal output
4. **Export Functionality**: Export command history or output to files
5. **Syntax Highlighting**: Advanced syntax highlighting for specific command types (e.g., JSON, logs)
6. **256-Color Support**: Extended ANSI color palettes beyond standard 16 colors
7. **Terminal Window Resizing**: Dynamic terminal size adjustment
8. **Copy/Paste Enhancements**: Advanced clipboard features (handled in Sprint 01)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Output Streaming Performance
**Risk**: High-volume output (e.g., `npm install`) could overwhelm UI and cause lag

**Mitigation**:
- Implement output buffering with batch UI updates (max 60 updates/second)
- Truncate very long output with "show more" option
- Monitor memory usage and implement automatic garbage collection

### Risk 2: Prompt Detection Accuracy
**Risk**: Custom or complex prompts may not be detected, causing command blocks to stay in "Executing" state

**Mitigation**:
- Pre-configure common prompt patterns (bash, zsh, etc.)
- Implement timeout fallback: if no prompt detected after 2 seconds of silence, mark as complete
- Allow manual prompt pattern configuration (future enhancement)

### Risk 3: Process Termination Reliability
**Risk**: Command cancellation may not always successfully terminate underlying process

**Mitigation**:
- Implement escalating termination: SIGTERM → SIGKILL with 2-second timeout
- Display warning to user if process doesn't terminate cleanly
- Prevent session corruption by isolating terminated processes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Output stream parsing (ANSI codes, prompt detection)
- State management (command block status transitions)
- Exit code capture and interpretation
- Working directory tracking logic

### Integration Testing
- Terminal core → Command Block UI data flow
- Session persistence and restoration
- Concurrent command execution
- Output streaming performance under load

### Acceptance Testing
Each functional requirement will be validated with acceptance scenarios defined in the requirements section. Key test scenarios:

1. **Basic Execution**: Execute `echo "Hello World"` and verify output appears correctly
2. **Colored Output**: Execute `ls --color=always` and verify colors render
3. **Error Handling**: Execute `cat nonexistent.txt` and verify error status
4. **Long Running**: Execute `sleep 10 && echo done` and verify streaming behavior
5. **Cancellation**: Execute `ping google.com`, cancel it, verify termination
6. **Persistence**: Execute commands, background app, restore, verify history intact

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-Sprint 02)

1. **Output Search**: Full-text search within command output
2. **Output Filtering**: Show only stderr, or filter by keywords
3. **256-Color Support**: Extended ANSI color palette
4. **Binary Output Handling**: Improved display of non-text output
5. **Configurable Prompts**: User-defined prompt patterns
6. **Multiple Sessions**: Manage several terminal sessions simultaneously
7. **Session Naming**: User-friendly names for sessions
8. **Export**: Save command history or output to files
9. **Syntax Highlighting**: Language-specific highlighting for JSON, XML, logs

## Notes

- This feature is the **critical path** to MVP - it transforms the app from a UI demo to a functional terminal emulator
- Success depends on clean integration between existing components (Terminal Core + Command Blocks UI)
- Performance is critical - mobile users expect instant responsiveness
- Real-time streaming is a key differentiator vs. traditional terminal apps
