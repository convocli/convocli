# Specification Quality Checklist: Android Project Foundation Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Review Notes**:
- Specification successfully balances technical infrastructure needs with technology-agnostic language
- User scenarios focus on developer experience outcomes rather than implementation steps
- Functional requirements describe "what" must exist without specifying "how" to build it
- Success criteria are measurable and focus on outcomes (build time, size, setup time)
- All acceptance criteria follow Given-When-Then format and are testable
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- Assumptions and Dependencies are well documented
- No clarifications needed - specification is complete and unambiguous

**Items marked complete**: All 17 checklist items passed

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Yes - proceed to `/specswarm:clarify` or `/specswarm:plan`
