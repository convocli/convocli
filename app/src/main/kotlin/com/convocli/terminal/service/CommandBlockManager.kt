 * Manages the lifecycle of command blocks: creation, updates, and completion.

 * Responsibilities:
 * - Create new command blocks when user submits commands
 * - Update blocks as output streams from the terminal
 * - Detect command completion using prompt patterns
 * - Maintain chronological sequence of blocks
 * - Provide observable stream of blocks for UI
 *
 * Thread-safety: All methods must be safe to call from multiple coroutines.
