# Feature: Command Blocks UI

**Feature ID**: 004
**Status**: Ready for Planning ✅
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22
**Clarifications Resolved**: 2025-10-22

---

## Overview

Transform ConvoCLI's terminal interface from a traditional text-based display into a modern, conversational chat-like experience using Material 3 cards. Each command and its output become discrete, interactive blocks that users can scroll, read, copy, and manipulate like messages in a messaging app. This is the core differentiator that makes ConvoCLI "Warp 2.0 for Android."

### Problem Statement

Feature 002 and 003 provide a fully functional Linux terminal on Android with command execution capabilities, but the user experience remains trapped in the traditional terminal paradigm: continuous scrolling text with no clear boundaries between commands, difficult to read on mobile screens, and no touch-optimized interactions. Mobile developers struggle with tiny text, accidental touches, and losing context in long command outputs. The current terminal interface doesn't leverage modern mobile UI patterns or Material Design principles.

### Solution

Implement a conversational block interface where each command execution becomes a Material 3 card containing the command input and its output. Users interact with commands like chat messages: clear visual separation, easy scrolling, touch-optimized actions, and collapsible content. The interface detects command boundaries using shell prompt patterns, parses ANSI color codes for syntax highlighting, and presents everything in a vertically scrolling list of cards that feels natural on mobile devices.

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Executing a Simple Command

**Actor**: Mobile developer using ConvoCLI to check project files

**Goal**: Execute a command and see results in an easy-to-read format

**Preconditions**:
- ConvoCLI launched with bootstrap installed
- User is in a project directory
- Command Blocks UI is the active interface mode

**Flow**:
1. User sees a clean Material 3 styled interface with a bottom input bar
2. User types "ls -la" in the input field at the bottom of the screen
3. User taps the send button (or presses Enter)
4. A new command block appears at the bottom of the scrolling list
5. The block shows "ls -la" as the command header with timestamp
6. The block displays the command output below the header
7. The block shows a success indicator (green checkmark or border)
8. User can scroll up to see previous commands
9. User can tap the output to see more details if it's long

**Success Outcomes**:
- Command and output are visually separated from other commands
- Output is readable on mobile screen (appropriate text size, wrapping)
- User can distinguish between command input and output at a glance
- Timestamp helps user track when command was executed
- Success/failure is immediately visible

**Edge Cases**:
- Long output (hundreds of lines) → Collapsed by default with "Show more" option
- Wide output (long lines) → Horizontal scrolling within the block
- Empty output → Block shows "No output" placeholder
- Output arrives slowly (streaming) → Block updates in real-time

---

### Scenario 2: Working with Multiple Commands

**Actor**: Developer debugging an application issue

**Goal**: Execute multiple commands and compare their outputs easily

**Preconditions**:
- User has executed several commands already
- Command history exists as blocks in the scrollable list

**Flow**:
1. User scrolls through previous command blocks
2. User can see command history at a glance (each block shows command and summary)
3. User spots a relevant previous command block
4. User taps on a collapsed block to expand and see full output
5. User compares output with current command results
6. User executes a new command based on findings
7. New block appears at the bottom of the list
8. User can scroll between old and new blocks easily

**Success Outcomes**:
- User can maintain context across multiple commands
- Previous commands remain accessible without scrollback search
- Visual separation makes it easy to distinguish commands
- Expanding/collapsing blocks helps manage screen real estate
- User doesn't lose their place when scrolling

**Edge Cases**:
- Many commands (50+) in history → Smooth scrolling performance maintained
- Mixed success/failure states → Clear visual indicators for each block
- User scrolls while command is executing → New output appears without disrupting scroll position

---

### Scenario 3: Interacting with Command Results

**Actor**: Developer who needs to copy command output or re-run a command

**Goal**: Perform actions on command results without typing again

**Preconditions**:
- At least one command block exists with output
- User wants to interact with the command or results

**Flow**:
1. User long-presses on a command block
2. Context menu appears with actions: Copy Output, Copy Command, Re-run, Edit & Run
3. User selects "Copy Output"
4. Output text is copied to clipboard
5. User sees brief confirmation toast "Output copied"
6. User can now paste the output elsewhere (another app, chat, etc.)

**Alternative Flow - Re-run**:
1. User taps "Re-run" from the context menu
2. Command executes again immediately
3. New command block appears with fresh results
4. Old block remains in history for comparison

**Alternative Flow - Edit & Run**:
1. User selects "Edit & Run"
2. Input field populates with the command text
3. User modifies the command as needed
4. User taps send to execute the modified command

**Success Outcomes**:
- User can copy results without manual text selection
- Re-running commands is quick and error-free
- Editing previous commands is faster than retyping
- Actions are discoverable and intuitive
- No accidental triggers (long-press is deliberate)

**Edge Cases**:
- Block is still executing → Re-run option is disabled
- Very large output to copy → Confirmation prompt before copying
- Command with sensitive data → Copy action works but user is responsible

---

### Scenario 4: Long-Running Command Execution

**Actor**: Developer running a build or installation command

**Goal**: Start a long-running command and monitor its progress

**Preconditions**:
- User wants to execute a command that takes several seconds/minutes
- Command produces streaming output

**Flow**:
1. User types command like "npm install" or "git clone <url>"
2. User taps send button
3. Command block immediately appears with "Executing..." indicator
4. Block shows a subtle loading animation or progress indicator
5. Output streams into the block as it arrives
6. User can scroll away and return to see updated output
7. When command completes, loading indicator changes to success/failure state
8. Block shows total execution time
9. User can immediately see if command succeeded or failed

**Success Outcomes**:
- User gets immediate feedback that command started
- Streaming output appears in real-time
- User isn't blocked from scrolling or viewing history
- Completion state is clear and unambiguous
- Execution time helps user understand command performance

**Edge Cases**:
- Command hangs or runs indefinitely → User can see it's still running and can cancel via Cancel button on the executing block
- Command produces massive output → Performance remains smooth with output throttling
- User backgrounds app during execution → Command continues and state is preserved
- Multiple long-running commands → Each block shows independent status

---

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Command Block Data Model

The system must maintain a data structure for each command execution containing:
- Unique identifier for the block
- Command text (user input)
- Command output (stdout and stderr combined)
- Execution status (pending, executing, success, failure)
- Timestamp of execution start
- Execution duration
- Exit code (when available)
- Working directory at time of execution

### FR-2: Command Block Display

Each command block must visually display:
- Command text prominently at the top of the card

- Execution status indicator (icon or color-coded border)
- Command output below the command text
- Execution duration when command completes
- Material 3 card styling with elevation and rounded corners

### FR-3: Prompt Detection and Command Boundaries

The system must:
- Detect shell prompt patterns (PS1) to identify command boundaries
- Recognize common prompt formats: `$ `, `# `, `user@host:~$ `, etc.
- Create a new block when a command is submitted

- Handle edge cases where prompts appear in command output

### FR-4: ANSI Color Code Parsing

The system must:
- Parse ANSI escape sequences in command output
- Convert ANSI color codes to Material 3 theme colors
- Preserve color and formatting in displayed output
- Handle basic formatting: bold, italic, underline
- Strip or convert unsupported escape sequences gracefully

### FR-5: Scrollable Command History

The interface must provide:

- Newest commands appear at the bottom (chat-like behavior)
- Smooth scrolling performance with many blocks (50+)
- Auto-scroll to newest block when new command executes
- Preserve scroll position when user manually scrolls up
- No pagination (continuous scroll with efficient rendering)

### FR-6: Block Expansion and Collapse

The system must:
- Automatically collapse command output exceeding a threshold (e.g., 20 lines)
- Show a "Show more" / "Show less" toggle for collapsed blocks
- Display first few lines and last few lines when collapsed
- Indicate total line count in collapsed state (e.g., "245 lines")
- Remember expansion state when user scrolls away and returns
- Apply consistent expansion behavior across all blocks

### FR-7: Block Actions

Each command block must support:
- **Copy Command**: Copy just the command text to clipboard
- **Copy Output**: Copy just the output text to clipboard
- **Copy All**: Copy command + output to clipboard
- **Re-run**: Execute the same command again
- **Edit & Run**: Populate input field with command for editing
- Visual confirmation feedback for each action (toast or snackbar)
- Actions accessible via long-press context menu or action buttons

### FR-8: Status Indicators

The system must provide clear visual indicators:
- **Pending**: Command submitted but not yet executing (loading icon)
- **Executing**: Command currently running (animated indicator, e.g., spinner or pulse)
- **Success**: Command completed with exit code 0 (green checkmark or border)
- **Failure**: Command completed with non-zero exit code (red X or border)
- Status must be visible without opening the block
- Color coding must be accessible (not color-only differentiation)

### FR-9: Material 3 Design Integration

The interface must:
- Use Material 3 Card components for command blocks
- Apply consistent elevation and shadows to cards
- Use theme-appropriate colors (respect light/dark mode)
- Follow Material Design spacing and typography guidelines

### FR-10: Command Input Integration

The command input must:
- Remain fixed at the bottom of the screen (always visible)
- Auto-focus when user taps in the input area
- Support multi-line input for complex commands
- Show clear send button to execute command
- Clear input field after successful command submission
- Integrate with TerminalViewModel from Feature 002
- Submit commands to TermuxTerminalRepository for execution

### FR-11: Empty State Handling

When no commands have been executed:
- Display a welcoming empty state message
- Show example commands or quick start tips
- Provide clear indication that user should type in the input field
- Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the interface

### FR-12: Performance Optimization

The system must:
- Render only visible blocks (virtualized/lazy loading for off-screen blocks)
- Throttle output updates for rapidly streaming commands
- Efficiently handle blocks with thousands of lines of output
- Maintain smooth scrolling performance (60fps target)
- Avoid memory leaks from retaining large command history
- Retain unlimited command blocks for the session duration (no automatic pruning)
- Monitor memory usage in production to assess if future pruning is needed

### FR-13: Command Cancellation

The system must provide command cancellation capability:
- Display a "Cancel" button on command blocks in EXECUTING state
- Send SIGINT signal to the running process when Cancel is tapped
- Transition block to FAILURE state with "Cancelled by user" message
- Show exit code 130 or 143 (standard for SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- Disable Cancel button once cancellation is initiated (prevent multiple signals)
- Provide visual feedback during cancellation (brief loading state)
- Clean up terminal session state appropriately after cancellation

## Key Entities

### CommandBlock

Represents a single command execution as a displayable unit.

**Attributes**:
- `id`: Unique identifier (String, UUID)
- `command`: The command text entered by user (String)
- `output`: Combined stdout/stderr output (String)
- `status`: Execution state (Enum: PENDING, EXECUTING, SUCCESS, FAILURE)

**Relationships**:
- Part of a chronological sequence managed by CommandBlockManager
- Linked to a TerminalSession from Feature 002

### CommandBlockManager

Orchestrates the creation, update, and lifecycle of command blocks.

**Responsibilities**:
- Listens to terminal output stream from TermuxTerminalRepository
- Detects command boundaries using prompt pattern matching
- Creates new CommandBlock when user submits command
- Updates existing block as output streams in
- Determines when block should transition to completed state
- Manages command history retention policy
- Provides interface for UI to query and manipulate blocks

**Relationships**:
- Observes TerminalOutput flow from TermuxTerminalRepository (Feature 002)
- Provides CommandBlock list to CommandBlockViewModel
- Integrates with WorkingDirectoryTracker for context

### CommandBlockViewModel

Manages UI state and user interactions for the blocks interface.

**Responsibilities**:
- Exposes StateFlow of CommandBlock list to Composable UI
- Handles user actions: execute command, copy, re-run, edit, expand/collapse
- Triggers commands through TerminalViewModel
- Manages scroll state and auto-scroll behavior
- Formats timestamps and durations for display
- Handles empty state logic

**Relationships**:
- Observes CommandBlockManager for block updates
- Delegates command execution to TerminalViewModel
- Consumed by CommandBlocksScreen composable

---

## Technical Constraints

### Constraint 1: Integration with Existing Terminal Infrastructure

The Command Blocks UI must integrate with the existing terminal architecture from Features 002-003:
- Must use TermuxTerminalRepository for command execution (no parallel execution system)
- Must preserve terminal session state and working directory
- Must respect terminal lifecycle (init, execute, output, destroy)
- Must handle terminal errors through existing error handling system

**Impact**: Cannot create a separate command execution system; must bridge existing terminal to new UI paradigm.

### Constraint 2: Android Performance Requirements

Target device specifications must be supported:
- Android 8.0+ (API 26+) - minimum SDK
- Low-end devices with 2GB RAM
- Older CPUs (Snapdragon 4xx series)
- Variable screen densities (mdpi to xxxhdpi)

**Impact**: Must optimize rendering, use virtualized lists, throttle updates, and test on low-end hardware.

### Constraint 3: Material Design Compliance

Must follow Material Design 3 guidelines:
- Use official Material 3 Compose components
- Respect dynamic color theming (Material You)
- Follow motion and animation guidelines
- Support light/dark theme switching
- Meet accessibility requirements (contrast ratios, touch targets)

**Impact**: Cannot use custom card implementations; must configure Material 3 Card component appropriately.

### Constraint 4: Jetpack Compose Version

Currently using Jetpack Compose 1.9.3 (BOM 2025.10.00):
- Must use stable APIs only (no experimental)
- LazyColumn for list rendering
- rememberSaveable for state persistence
- AnimatedVisibility for expand/collapse

**Impact**: Cannot use Compose features newer than 1.9.3 without upgrade coordination.

## Assumptions

### Assumption 1: Command Prompt Format

We assume the shell prompt follows standard conventions:
- Bash default: `user@host:~$ ` or `$ ` or `# `
- Ending with `$ ` or `# ` followed by a space
- Consistent within a session (user doesn't change PS1 mid-session)

**Rationale**: Termux bootstrap uses standard bash with default prompts. Custom prompts are edge cases that can be addressed post-MVP.

**Risk**: If users customize prompts heavily, command boundary detection may fail. Mitigation: Document prompt requirements and provide configuration option in later phase.

### Assumption 2: Output Volume Threshold

We assume "long output" that should be collapsed is:
- More than 20 lines of text
- When collapsed, show first 10 lines and last 5 lines
- Display total line count when collapsed

**Rationale**: 20 lines is approximately one phone screen of text at typical font sizes. Balances readability with space efficiency.

**Risk**: User preference varies. Mitigation: Could make threshold configurable in settings later.

### Assumption 3: Command History Retention

We assume command history should:
- Retain all commands for the current session
- Clear history when app terminates (not persisted across launches)
- No automatic pruning of old commands during session

**Rationale**: MVP focuses on current session workflow. Persistence adds complexity and storage concerns. Users can always scroll back.

**Risk**: Very long sessions could accumulate hundreds of blocks. Mitigation: Monitor memory usage and implement pruning if needed (noted in FR-12 as needing clarification).

**Related Clarification**: See FR-12 for decision on history retention limits.

### Assumption 4: ANSI Color Support Scope

We assume basic ANSI support is sufficient:
- Standard 16 colors (8 colors + bright variants)
- Basic formatting: bold, italic, underline
- No support for: 256-color palette, true color (24-bit), complex escape sequences

**Rationale**: Most terminal output uses basic colors. Complex color schemes are rare in command output.

**Risk**: Some tools (ls with complex themes, syntax highlighters) may not render perfectly. Mitigation: 95% of output will look good; edge cases acceptable for MVP.

### Assumption 5: Mobile-First Interaction Model

We assume users primarily interact via:
- Touch gestures (tap, long-press, swipe)
- On-screen keyboard for input
- Portrait orientation primarily (landscape is nice-to-have)

**Rationale**: ConvoCLI targets mobile developers on Android phones. Desktop use cases (via scrcpy, etc.) are secondary.

**Risk**: Landscape and keyboard/mouse users may find interaction suboptimal. Mitigation: Focus on 90% use case (portrait touch), enhance others later.

### Assumption 6: Real-Time Output is Expected

We assume users expect:
- Streaming output to appear as it's generated (not batched)
- Long-running commands to show progress in real-time
- Output updates should not significantly lag actual command progress

**Rationale**: Developers need immediate feedback for builds, installations, and other long operations.

**Risk**: Very fast output (thousands of lines per second) could cause performance issues. Mitigation: Throttle updates to maintain 60fps (noted in FR-12).

### Assumption 7: Single Terminal Session

We assume a single active terminal session for MVP:
- One command executes at a time (no parallel execution)
- One command block is "active" (executing) at any time
- No tab/split view for multiple sessions

**Rationale**: Multi-session support is complex and not required for MVP. Most mobile terminal use is serial command execution.

**Risk**: Power users may want parallel commands. Mitigation: Note as Phase 2 feature; ensure architecture doesn't prevent it.

---

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly NOT Included in This Feature

1. **Traditional Terminal Mode**
   - A fallback VT-100 terminal view for interactive programs (vim, htop)
   - Rationale: Command blocks work for standard commands; interactive programs need different UI
   - Future: Feature 008 or later

2. **Multi-Session/Tab Support**
   - Multiple terminal sessions running in parallel
   - Rationale: Adds complexity; single session sufficient for MVP
   - Future: Phase 2 (Month 4-6)

3. **Command Palette**
   - Quick command search and execution via "/" trigger
   - Rationale: Different feature; not required for basic block functionality
   - Future: Feature 009 (Month 3, Week 9-10)

4. **Persistent Command History**
   - Saving command blocks across app restarts
   - Rationale: Adds storage complexity and privacy concerns
   - Future: Phase 2 with ConvoSync

5. **Advanced ANSI Features**
   - 256-color palette, true color (24-bit), cursor positioning, terminal resizing
   - Rationale: Rarely used in command output; adds parsing complexity
   - Future: If user demand arises

6. **Syntax Highlighting**
   - Code syntax highlighting within command output
   - Rationale: Complex feature requiring language detection and parsing
   - Future: Feature 005 (Smart Command Cards) may add basic version

7. **Block Filtering/Search**
   - Search through command history or filter by command type
   - Rationale: Not essential for MVP with small command counts
   - Future: Phase 2 when command history becomes large

8. **Export/Share Session**
   - Export command blocks as text, screenshot, or shareable format
   - Rationale: Useful but not blocking for core functionality
   - Future: Phase 2 with sharing features

9. **Command Cancellation UI**
   - Button to cancel/interrupt running command from UI
   - Rationale: Requires signal handling implementation in terminal layer
   - Future: Depends on clarification in FR-12 and terminal capabilities

---

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Command Cancellation - Include in MVP ✅

**Chosen**: Option A - Add Cancel Button

**Rationale**: Users expect the ability to stop long-running commands (builds, installations, large clones). Including cancellation in MVP provides essential terminal functionality and prevents users from feeling trapped during long operations.

**Implementation**: FR-13 defines the cancellation capability - Cancel button on executing blocks sends SIGINT to the process, transitioning block to FAILURE state with appropriate messaging.

**Trade-offs Accepted**: Adds implementation complexity (signal handling) and UI complexity (Cancel button states), but the user value justifies the effort.

### Decision 2: Command History Retention - Unlimited for MVP ✅

**Chosen**: Option A - Unlimited History

**Rationale**: Modern Android devices (4-8GB RAM) can easily handle hundreds of command blocks with efficient rendering (LazyColumn virtualization). Unlimited history provides best user experience without arbitrary limits.

**Implementation**: FR-12 specifies no automatic pruning, relying on efficient rendering and memory leak prevention. Monitor production usage to assess if future pruning is needed.

**Trade-offs Accepted**: Risk of memory pressure in very long sessions (hundreds of commands), but this is an acceptable MVP limitation. Can add smart pruning in Phase 2 based on real-world usage data.

**Note on Bash History**: Bash maintains its own command history (HISTSIZE ~500-1000 commands) separate from our UI blocks. Our unlimited retention applies only to visual command blocks displayed in the UI.

---

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Prompt Detection Accuracy

**Risk**: Shell prompt patterns vary; may fail to detect command boundaries correctly

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High (blocks won't form correctly)

**Mitigation**:
- Test with default Termux bash prompt (well-defined)
- Support most common prompt formats
- Provide escape hatch: configurable prompt pattern in settings (Phase 2)
- Document supported prompt formats

### Risk 2: Performance with Large Output

**Risk**: Commands with thousands of lines (e.g., npm install) may cause lag or memory issues

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (poor user experience)

**Mitigation**:
- Implement output throttling (update block max once per 100ms)
- Use LazyColumn for efficient rendering
- Collapse long output by default
- Test with real-world large outputs during development

### Risk 3: ANSI Parsing Complexity

**Risk**: ANSI escape sequences are complex; parser may fail on edge cases

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Low (cosmetic issues, not functional breakage)

**Mitigation**:
- Start with basic color support (16 colors)
- Gracefully degrade unsupported sequences (strip them)
- Test with real command output from common tools
- Accept that 5% of edge cases may not render perfectly

### Risk 4: Integration with Existing Terminal

**Risk**: Bridging existing TermuxTerminalRepository to block paradigm may introduce bugs

**Likelihood**: Low (terminal layer is tested)
**Impact**: High (core functionality broken)

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive integration tests from Feature 002 still pass
- Gradual rollout: develop feature on branch, test thoroughly before merge
- Fallback plan: Keep traditional terminal as alternative (out of scope for this feature but noted)
