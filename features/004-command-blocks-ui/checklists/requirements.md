# Specification Quality Checklist: Command Blocks UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Spec is business-focused with clear user scenarios and success criteria. Technical Constraints section appropriately documents existing system limitations without prescribing implementation.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Resolution**:
âœ… All clarifications resolved:
1. **Command Cancellation**: Decided to include Cancel button (Option A) - documented in FR-13 and Design Decisions
2. **History Retention**: Decided on unlimited history (Option A) - documented in FR-12 and Design Decisions

**Status**: âœ… All requirements complete and unambiguous

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: 13 functional requirements defined (FR-1 through FR-13) with clear acceptance criteria. 4 detailed user scenarios cover primary and edge cases. Success criteria include quantitative metrics (60fps, 90% readability) and qualitative measures (user preference).

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE - READY FOR PLANNING**

**Passing Checks**: 15/15 (100%)

**Resolved Issues**:
- âœ… Command cancellation capability defined (FR-13)
- âœ… History retention policy specified (FR-12)
- âœ… Design decisions documented

**Next Steps**:
1. âœ… Specification quality validated
2. âœ… All clarifications resolved
3. ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for `/specswarm:plan`** - Generate implementation plan

## Resolved Clarifications

### âœ… Question 1: Command Cancellation (FR-4, Scenario 4)

**Decision**: Include Cancel button in MVP (Option A)

**Documented In**:
- FR-13: Command Cancellation functional requirement
- Design Decisions section: Full rationale and trade-offs
- Scenario 4 edge cases: Updated with cancellation capability

### âœ… Question 2: Command History Retention (FR-12)

**Decision**: Unlimited history for MVP (Option A)

**Documented In**:
- FR-12: Performance Optimization with unlimited retention policy
- Design Decisions section: Rationale including note on Bash HISTSIZE
- Assumptions section: Clarified session-scoped retention
