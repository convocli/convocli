## üîç Actual Usage Entries

### 2025-10-21 - /specswarm:complete

**Command**: `/specswarm:complete`
**Feature/Context**: Feature 002 - Termux Integration merge to main branch
**Phase**: Completion
**Invoked By**: ‚úÖ User directly
**Duration**: ~2 minutes
**Status**: ‚úÖ Success

**Purpose**:
Merge Feature 002 (Termux Integration - Terminal Emulator Core) to main branch after successful build validation. This was the completion of an 8-phase implementation with 47 tasks, 70+ tests, and comprehensive documentation.

**Input/Arguments**:
- None (command run without arguments)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Feature branch merged to main with --no-ff
- Local feature branch deleted
- Remote push successful
- Feature status updated to "Complete"
- Clean, guided workflow with confirmation prompts

**Actual Outcome**:
- ‚úÖ Successfully merged 70 files, 21,132 insertions to main
- ‚úÖ Pushed to origin/main (merge commit: b0342ed)
- ‚úÖ Deleted local branch (002-termux-integration-terminal-emulator-core-for-android-command-execution)
- ‚úÖ Kept remote branch for historical reference (user choice)
- ‚úÖ Updated spec.md status to "Complete"
- ‚úÖ Guided workflow with clear phases: Cleanup ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Cleanup

**Files Generated/Modified**:
- Merge commit created: `b0342ed` "Merge feature: Termux Integration - Terminal Emulator Core"
- Modified: `features/002-.../spec.md` (status updated to Complete)
- No diagnostic files to clean up (clean working tree)

**Issues Encountered**:
- None - workflow executed flawlessly

**Workarounds Applied**:
- None needed

**Lessons Learned**:
- `/specswarm:complete` provides excellent guided workflow with clear phase separation
- User confirmation at each critical step prevents mistakes
- --no-ff merge preserves feature history beautifully in git log
- Branch cleanup is flexible (can keep remote for historical reference)
- Status updates are automatic (spec.md updated)
- Works perfectly even when working tree is already clean

**Recommendations for Plugin Improvement**:
- ‚úÖ **Already excellent** - no critical improvements needed
- **Nice-to-have**: Optional sprint branch detection (e.g., "Merge to sprint-02 instead of main?")
- **Nice-to-have**: Option to auto-delete remote branch (currently always asks)
- **Nice-to-have**: Summary statistics in final output (lines changed, commits merged, etc.)

**Integration with Other Commands**:
- Preceded by: Manual implementation (Feature 002 phases 1-8)
- Followed by: N/A (feature complete)
- Related commands:
  - `/specswarm:implement` (would normally precede this)
  - `/specswarm:bugfix` (if issues found post-merge)

**Would Use Again**: ‚úÖ Yes, as-is (excellent tool)

**Next Command**: `/specswarm:analyze-quality` (to validate merged feature before building on it)
