# Specification Quality Checklist: Terminal Output Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- âœ… Spec is technology-agnostic (no mention of Kotlin, Android, etc.)
- âœ… Focus is on what users need (real-time output, colors, state management)
- âœ… All sections are complete and well-structured

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- âœ… **All clarifications resolved**:
  1. FR4: Pre-configured prompt patterns (bash, zsh, sh) for Sprint 02, custom patterns future enhancement âœ“
  2. FR6: stderr displayed in red text to align with terminal conventions âœ“
  3. FR9: Working directory in command block header (Warp-style design) âœ“
- âœ… All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- âœ… Success criteria are measurable (100ms latency, 95% accuracy, etc.)
- âœ… Success criteria avoid implementation details ("users see results" not "API responds")
- âœ… Edge cases covered: errors, cancellation, long-running commands, binary output
- âœ… Out of scope section clearly bounds the feature
- âœ… Dependencies and assumptions well documented

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- âœ… 9 functional requirements, each with specific acceptance criteria
- âœ… 4 user scenarios: primary flow, long-running, errors, cancellation
- âœ… Success criteria align with functional requirements
- âœ… Specification is implementation-agnostic

---

## Clarifications Resolved

All 3 clarification questions have been answered and incorporated into the specification:

### âœ… Q1: Custom Prompt Pattern Configuration
**Decision**: Option C - Pre-configured patterns (bash, zsh, sh) for Sprint 02, user-configurable patterns planned for future enhancement

**Rationale**: Keeps MVP focused while providing clear enhancement path

### âœ… Q2: Visual Distinction for stderr
**Decision**: Option A - stderr displayed in red text

**Rationale**: Aligns with terminal conventions, improves error visibility, better UX

### âœ… Q3: Working Directory Display Location
**Decision**: Option A - Display in each command block header (Warp-style)

**Rationale**: Provides historical context, matches Warp's proven design pattern

---

## Status

**Overall Assessment**: âœ… **SPECIFICATION COMPLETE & READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, comprehensive, and ready for implementation planning. All clarifications have been resolved, functional requirements are testable, success criteria are measurable, and the feature scope is clearly defined.

**Next Steps**:
1. âœ… Clarifications resolved and spec updated
2. âœ… All validation criteria passed
3. ðŸŽ¯ Ready to proceed to `/specswarm:plan` for implementation architecture

---

## Notes

- Feature is well-scoped for Sprint 02 (12-16 hour estimate)
- All dependencies are met (Features 002 and 004 complete)
- Success criteria are measurable and achievable
- Risk mitigation strategies are documented
- Testing strategy is comprehensive
