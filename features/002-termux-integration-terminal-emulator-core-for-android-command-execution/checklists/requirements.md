# Specification Quality Checklist: Termux Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on user needs and business value. Technical details are limited to constraints section which is appropriate. No framework-specific implementation details in requirements.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 9 functional requirements have clear, testable acceptance criteria. No ambiguous requirements found. Scope is well-defined with explicit "Out of Scope" section.

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All success criteria include measurable metrics:
- SC-1: < 200ms for simple commands, < 100ms UI latency
- SC-2: 1+ hour uptime, 1000+ commands
- SC-3: 10,000+ lines, < 50MB memory, 10MB outputs
- SC-4: < 100ms perceived delay
- SC-5: Standard Linux commands work correctly

All criteria are technology-agnostic and user-focused.

### User Scenarios Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Five comprehensive scenarios covering:
- Basic command execution
- Directory navigation
- File viewing
- Error handling
- Learning environment

Scenarios are realistic and testable.

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to `/specswarm:plan` phase. No clarifications needed.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear separation of concerns (terminal emulator vs. UI)
- Well-defined out-of-scope items prevent scope creep
- Comprehensive error handling requirements
- Realistic success criteria with measurable metrics
- Technical constraints properly documented without dictating implementation

**Recommendations**:
- Consider adding FR for terminal resize handling in future iterations
- May want to add success criterion for session recovery after crashes
